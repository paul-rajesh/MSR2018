|inside android_surface_output_omap34xx.cpp
we are checking for -EPERM condition to free the queued buffers in case of stream off called while rendering is happening.
|and one more point is that, omap4 dss driver doesnt need two buffers to be kept in the queue like omap3 dss driver.
omap4 driver can work with single buffer as well. anyways i will add comments.
|currently for ARM based codecs, we cant buffer more than one buffer as arm decoders are working on only two buffers.
if we try to buffer 2 at the v4l2 level, there will be a dead lock.
this will be changed once we move to ducati decoder completely.
|this is already defined in v4l2_utils.
so, i have included that file directly to avoid redundancy
in defining the data structures.
|since different scope, not a problem. 
anyway i will delete the above one.
|ok.
|ok.
|no there is no arm playback support in omap3.
|this is to support the legacy apps which will continue to provide zero as the display id.
|OVERLAY_SCREEN_ID is the parameter
and the primary/secondary/tv etc are the values for that screen.
may be i can make a separate enum for screens?
|we are using it down. this is to get the current parameters
for the layer
|ideally surface flinger should be silicon agnostic. its upto hw abstraction layer like overlay library to ignore or service as per the silicon capabilities.
|core_plugin and ti_omx_config_parser folders should be common between omap3 and omap4. hence the last two calls should be there for omap4 as well.
|why do we have to enable secondary display right from boot?
we may have enable it dynamically based on some key press or surface flinger commands.
|w*h check can't be to the exact 720p size.
there are codecs which would give buffers with padding, hence the overlay size would exceed 720p even for 720p video playback. we should give some buffering, but by how much???we need to see.
|hi Carlos,
Ideally we have to create the Overlay with the buffer size instead of the clip resolution, right.
i think currently we are doing this way. i'm correcting this in my today's patches.
|see main function and Overlay function for details on this.
here are the user options
ZOOM: option 7
CROP: Option 6 or option 7
Rotation: Option3
Blend/Alpha: Option1
|ok i will define constants for this.
|Yes, currently all the overlay data structures are re-defined at the video MIO and camera HAL level.
in order to avoid this duplicates, i moved the shared data structures into the common folder, hence clients can just refer to this. this way any changes in overlay can easily be communicated/reflected at mio and camera hal level.
|it is not a problem as Video MIO and Camera HAL passes the format explicitly. anyway i can default it to YUV422-I.
|we need to close the fd first and then destroy the overlay object.
|i didnt get the comment fully.
this array is a class member holding the reference to overlay object. and the fd is video device file descriptor inside the overlay object.
so unless i close the overlay object fully, i wont remove the reference. but as part of this review i found few potential issues which i captured above !
|fd is an integer and ZERO is possible value if this is the first fd in this process. i will check for -ve values and OPEN_MAX bounds.
|this patch is re-arch of the existing code base and features.
all these additional configurability is part of the subsequent patches. for color key please review patch #3149
|YES. mOmapOverlays[i] is populated only at the end of overlay create where the overlay object is successfully created.
|buffer attributes are configurable via setParameter api.
the default values i will make sure that they are same as in omap3, so we dont break anything in omap3.
|No. these are two different interfaces and the purpose is also entirely different.
Commit --&gt; This is used by surface flinger to update the overlay parameters upon every time the ONVISIBILITY is resolved by the window manager. it means every time when the window has to be resized or rotated or alpha to be chnaged etc.

ResizeInput --&gt; this is the interface for the Video MIO or the CameraHAL to destroy and re-create the overlay when the overlay size changes. like in H.263 decoder where the overlay size is not known in the beginning unless first frame is decoded. upon decoder callback the overlay is recreated with this resizeInput API.

Ideally InitializeOverlay and resizeInput are redundant and may be we can aim to unify them internally.
|fd can be ZERO.
i will add checks for -ve and OPEN_MAX bounds.
|fd can be NULL/ZERO.
i will add checks for -ve and OPEN_MAX.
|two pipe lines are controlled by two overlay objects right.
and this mutex is overlay object specific, hence parallel posting is not hindered.
|fd can be NULL/ZERO.
will add checks for -ve and OPEN_MAX bounds.
|ok, i will add.
|ok. i will modify.
|Static: because we need to populate the function pointers for the surface flinger to access these, we have to make them static functions.

Re-entrant: every data structure is overlay obj specific and local variables are on stack, hence reentrancy is guaranteed and safe.
i have tested having two overlays simultaneously active from single process and from multiple processes.
|same answers as above.
|yes, i will optimize this.
|yes, i will optimize this.
|is there any driver level interface to query this?
|just to catch the error scenario, hope this is ok.
|in case of empty file also, we can just close it and send error right?
|these are not generic read/write functions.
hence here we dont know how many bytes we have to read.
i'm giving PATH_MAX as the bytes to be read.
|manager name is used in the next patch while setting up the panels :)
and incorporate your suggestion for the second logic.
|yes, i will incorporate the min() logic.
but we dont have logic which normalizes the co-ordinates from 255 to 3.
thats why i hardcoded to max limit as 2.
|in OMAP3 it is hardcoded to 0x00.
the previous version on the left side is from the new overlay code, not the omap3 one.
|if nBuffers_queued_to_dss = 0
the condition is not handled correctly.
look at the comments in overlay.cpp for this scenario
|nOverlayBufferQueued should be decremented irrespective of
whether the camera buffer queuing succeeds or not.
|remove trailing spaces
|i am seeing a potential race condition possible here. may be we need mutex locking across the qd_buf_count variable.

the race condition: after the stream is enabled, but before returning the queued buffer count, if the commit happens and disables the stream, the queued count buffer count
would be reset to zero.
 and quebuffer api returns ZERO.
in this case CameraHAL behaves as if the buffer is queued after the stream off, but ideally not.
|potential race condition: if the queueBuffer call is pre-empted by commit and resets the buffer that just got queued.
im referring to the scenario where stream off is called, after
stream on but before returning from the queue buffer call.
refer to the dependent patch comments for more details of this scenario.
|i understand the requirement for timings
but why is manager0/display ?
is it not the same as manager0/name?
|remove white spaces
|if you see commit() api,
i'm not configuring the panel everytime, unless it is chnaged.
since the reset value of the panel is &quot;0&quot; (primary lcd), if we ask for
primary lcd, there is no change triggered at the commit api.
with the above background, inorder to meet the below usecase, this reset
is required:
(1) open overlay and request it for 2lcd
video should be played on secondary lcd
(2) destroy overlay and close the app

(3) open the overlay and request for lcd
video should be played on primary lcd.
|ofcourse it is a design decision.
i thought we can handle the error scenario by defaulting the panel.
what is your suggestion?
|ok, i will query from sysfs.
but i didnt get your point : this only works if UI is on LCD.
why?
|yes, i will incorporate your comment.
|i will add primary lcd in this case.
|ok.
|ok, i will query from sysfs.
|what about the chances are entering into other elseif condifitons than
asrcformat == adstformat ?

i mean what if the dst format is RGB? who will configure it?
|where is it defined. i have compiled and observed that it is enabled but
couldn't find out where.
|replace these tabs with white space
|replace LOGE with LOGD so that they dont appear as error statements.
Replace tabs with spaces.
|replace tabs with spaces
|the above w &amp; h are read based on the screen ID, which is lcd
in the case where we control HDMI from command line.
since it is an alternative and temporary solution, i dont want to
corrupt the original design. Hence hardcoded.
|how did you arrive at skip bytes value to be 32?
|If you see commit function, i'm using the cropX and cropY variable for 
window size calculation for HDMI. 
Here we have configured the v4l2 but the parameters are not initialized,
hence in the window calculation, i'm getting zero width and v4l2 set window 
fails.
|Anu, 
If you OMAP3 solution, always stream is disabled before setting the crop.
since i'm not sure of omap3 v4l2 driver behavior, i didnt modify anything in
overlay for omap3.
where as for omap4, the v4l2 driver supports setCrop only if the co-ordinates are chnages, but not the crop window size. Hence, i kept same checks in overlay as well for omap4
|I have tested it with 1.15 ducati image and observed the noffset coming properly. I dont see any dependency on Deva's patch.
|one way is to check here and avoid, But i have optimized setCrop to avoid prints and minimal checks to return immediately. see the patch for overlay crop.
|Hi Anu,
Is this the requirement only from test app??
I have confirmed that this new macro is not used anywhere in OMAP3 code.
|This is the stride for ARM while accessing TILER buffers.
|okay, i think we have modify test app for return value check for this.
|Hi anu,
We dont have this error scenario in overlay_test app.
did you add for omap3?
|Initially we allowed resizeInput to be called even when the stream is ON, to support new camera mode switches in OMAP4. As part of that we added this scenario, so that if the call comes from camera HAL for the same size (between HS mode HQ mode switch) we can just flush the old buffers and return.
|this is the requirement from imaging team.
they wanted a mechanism to flush the buffers without destroying the overlay.
|offset in pixels is an int, and holds the difference between two addresses.
so i will hold the bytes, right!

may be i ddint get your point fully.
|there shouldn't be any platform specific macro's in Surface flinger.
We are handling it in Overlay.
|remove the dead code added for testing.
|Change this LOGE to more specific mask, as this is not error scenario and is not expected to come in every run.
|Change this LOGE to more specific mask, as this is not error scenario and is not expected to come in every run.

|why is OMX constant defined in hardware specific file?
|Remove traces.
|how did you arrive at this constant?
|if the sys file ops are going through fine with mutex held, lets not
unlock it here, otherwise the below piece of v4l2 calls are not protected.
earlier the logic was to exclude mutex lock for sysfile ops.
|mutex has already been unlocked at the top and hence we can't go to end here. Dont know the impact of unlocking mutex without locking it.
And since the sys-file reads/writes are moved up, it is required to handle mutex lock/unlock appropriately.
|Kalpesh,

I understand error scenario handling.
My concern is if there is no constraint from file ops with mutex held,
there is no need to unlock mutex at the top.
|see the comment added next to it.
|currently pipeline0 and pipeline1 are reserved for fb0 and fb1, right?
for overlay we are using pipeline2 and pipeline3.
How did you arrive at pipeline1 here?
|ctx-&gt;omap_overlay should be checked for NULL  here.
|The check should be moved up.
|This is just a query # 
In case of s3dmode = off, do we still have to reset all these fmt, order and ss parameters?
wont they get reset when we turnoff s3d mode?
|where is it used?
|The return value from set_s3d_params is dropped here??

|why is it initialized to 1 here?
|Is this CameraService code specific to OMAP4??
else, we may have to add TARGET_OMAP4 check as well.
|The silicon specific checks are added in overlay to avoid any run time errors for omap3. I suggest the same option even in camera hal.
|updatewindow() would be redundant for OMAP enhancement.
can't this be avoided?
|Hi Jorge,

As i explained above, the reason for defining it here is because i need this constant in OMXCodec.cpp as well.
|I defined it here because this constant is referred in OMXCodec.cpp to setup the port configuration.
|I'm going to change the below logic and assumption as part my other patch: support for S/W rendering where in even for playback i need to allocate buffers on Ducati side.
So, the cleanup will be done as part of that.

if(mQuirks &amp; kRequiresAllocateBufferOnOutputPorts)
//thumbnail usecase
|This is required as the base class is an abstract class (setDisplayId is pure virtual there).
|Hi Chris,

init and SetDisplay are getting called from my apk equivalent frameworks component. that is in separate patch.
|yes, you are right. it is because i used your reference template.
Initially i thought i can do some cleanup here.
but not sure what to clean up !
hence left it empty.
|need to check for &lt;=0, to take care of error -1 scenarios.
|This logic can be removed as the color format is handled
correctly at omxcodec level.
|what about adding the flags for interlaced content here??? if the content is interlaced.
|this will be removed once we resolve the flash compatibility issue.
then the code is maintained only in Codec.
|no specific reason.
Inorder to differentiate the java function from jni function, i have to give a different name.
And since i'm goign to lock it for 1sec, i named it this way.
|why is this logic required?
The below logic should be able to handle it correctly, right?
|is it typo?? it should be mSettingsMenu1?
|should it be mSettingsMenu1?
|should it be mSettingsMenu2??
|Hi Kalpesh,
This scenario may not happen as mReceiver is getting created in the constructor itself. without that the control wouldn't have come till here.
|Why do we need to override constructor as well?
anyway we have Create function above, right?
|I think we should leave the constructor private and inherit Create.
This maintains the basic design of instantiating codec from base class only.
|why is this needed?
|Why is this zorder setting not required for s3d case??
|why is this manager reset excluded?
any specific reason?
|this one should be commented right?
|I will remove this.
|Hi Keith,

Yes, you are right. But currently Android metadata.h doesn't define (or include) interlaced as the parameter.
We are working on including all the missing parameters into metadata.h and populate them using TI parser. Once that is done, we can remove this.
But till then we are passing this an additional parameter.
|Introducing silicon specific macros in surfaceflinger may not be a good idea.
If the customer uses per-pixel alpha blending, then this patch is applicable even for them right?
|Hi Jean,

Infact this code was added by TI, hence it is not an issue.
but the previous patch where we added this code would have had macro, i will add it now.
|I thought so. But left it, as the default/initial setting to start with, and change it in the commit call.
any pros/cons for this???
|can we safely assume 1 frame per sample?
or should we handle multi frame per sample as well? just a query....
|i think you will try out (totalframes*1000000)/duration, right.
|Sujeet,
As we discussed in meeting, i'm leaving these last two params as they will not impact any functionality.
|this interface may be needed.
but, what is the reason for excluding them from this interface?
|Not clear about this class usage.
|Please ignore the above comment.
|If the intention is to abstract overlayfacade object inside v4l2 wrapper, how can the client access this Overlayfacade to make calls like setcrop, get buffers etc.
|What happens to video/devx opened in control path??
and what about control settings for this devcie like:
window positioning and window size, alpha, z-order etc which are controlled by surface flinger.
|can't we extend the existing overlay data path with additional parameters to handle v4l2_gfx device???
|All these parameters are defined in Overlay object so that they are accessible from control as well as data contexts.
is it not redundant here?
|whenever this call succeeds, in that scenario
(1) I assume that the video format for the renderer is in sync with the texture buffer format.
(2) and where does the renderer get these textured buffers from?
(3)
|Why is this change not protected under OMAP_ENHANCEMENT.

|how did we arrive at 8x8 overlay size?
I know currently the DR specific you-tube video is 8x8.
but what is the theoritical limit in h/w?
|Hi Kalpesh,

No, for Video switching we needn't inform media player, it will be purely control context switch.
|Hi Dan,

Thanks for comments.
Yes, register and unregister count matches, We get broadcast notification as many times as we register.

And coming to re-registering, if you closely look at the register call, i'm passing &quot;NULL&quot; for receiver. This is done intentionally so that it doesn't get registered but will just update the intent with the last sticky broadcasted value.
|Hi Tyler,
We dont have mSurface at Camera hal level.
And Clone request is on ISurface interface.
|ok, i was assuming the return value for memcmp to be &quot;1&quot;, but realized that it is &quot;0&quot; if string matches.
|shoudn't this be &#124;&#124; logic??
From the description it seems we have are allowing the file parser if atleast mdat is present.
|This is in the resizeInput right.
My assumption is it is the default and gets corrected in commit function.
|The below one is working for OMAP3.
Hence i don't want to change their settings.
OMAP4 is definitely different but not sure whether the same works for OMAP3.
|This is the default value and we change it from setParam
|Hi Anu,
With V4L2 we can set only on the current fd, right.
Hence for overlay0 and Overlay1 which are used for framebuffer, i have changed the default values in kernel.
please refer to the patch #10675 for this
|Hi misa,
this is a good question. If you see  even UEVENT MATCH also referring to display2.
on TI deliverables, yes HDMI is always display2 as we have two LCDs for display0 and display1.
|Hi Dan,

Ginger bread is the same as Froyo wrt HDMI support.
This is the file we have added in Froyo and need to carry to GB.
And coming to uEvent vs switcher class, as Kalpesh mentioned, this is the
intentional design which misa/ricky can explain.
|loge?
|loge?
|the above mNumFramesPlayed update logic seems to be like updating the time even before the buffer is played? If that is the case, should we advance interpolation time forward or backward?
|where are we using this previoustime? And in the above print statement we are using this previoustime variable even before it is read. is this intentional??
|where is this previouspt used?? only for print in the next iteration?
|Is 1msec not too frequent to check for events?

|I will fix it as a separate patch when i add camera cloning.
|Hi Keith,

The above #define can be used to enable/disable this feature.
If we comment the #define, then all the subsequent checks would fail hence the feature would be disabled.
|considering the fact that it is a genuine fix which is applicable for all platforms irrespective of OMAP or not, and also this is not a feature which customer would be interested in enabling/disabling via OMAP macro, i feel macro protection is not required for this line change.

Probably we can even submit this to google tree.
|Hi Saket,

This is not a new implementation we are introducing here.
This is purely a bug fix in the driver. If you look at init code in the same file, we are already taking care of this swap, but here some how it was missed, and somebody even left &quot;TODO&quot; comment for this !

And coming to SurfaceFlinger and userside Overlay, we have a logic in Overlay to always make sure that the W&amp;H are given in zero degree.
If this kernel was working with UBUNTU and other HLOS , it will continue to work as this is just a bug fix, not a feature break.
|Okay, I will put it in a new function and call.
|Yes you are right.
I didnt do that only because OMAP3 needs posX posY Calculation as well along with window width and height.
we can do that and get it verified from OMAP3 team.
|What about error scenario where emptyBuffer call fails?
We need to reset this back.
|same as above
|same comment above
|Hi Kalpesh,

All these are CEA codes as per HDMI Spec.
I Will see if i can define something like 1080i, etc..
|Hi Dan/Srinivas,

These sysFS have read/write permissions may be at root level.
But when we try to access them from SurfaceFlinger and Media Server it doesn't work.
Hence we are setting the owner and giving permissions for the owner.
|Hi Kalpesh,

In that case we are relying on OMAP DSS downscaling.
Becuse info.out_width and info.out_height are the overlay window going out of OMAP.
Hence TV will still receive 720p in your above example, but OMAP will do dopwnscaling.
I have already tested this scenario.
|for OMAP4 incase of 90 and 270 degree rotation we have to interchange W and H.
This is how V4L2 expects.
|Hi Dan,
yes, CHECK_EQ has a return value.
but i didn't get your second point and what exactly is the comment here?
|This MAX_RESOLUTION is not 1080p.
In case of OMAP4 we need to support till 1080p.
|ZOrder is specific to OMAP4 Hardware.
It will be ignored at V4L2 and DSS overlay level for OMAP3 processor.
|We should return error from here if setting the constraint fails.
|In case of fifo overflow, we didn't insert any message, right?
Then why do we need to queue work?
|Isn't it 

return (a &gt;&gt; right) &amp; ((2 &lt;&lt; (left - right)) - 1);
|Hi Kalpesh,

As we discussed, this is as per CDD 2.3 compatibility, we have to have @hide annotation even for private classes
|Alllocate buffers on Input port is enabled here. Is it an intended change in this patch??
Recently saket has submitted a patch to comment this quirk.
|should we also add &quot;avc1&quot; brand here?
And i feel we should list down all other compatible brands and add to this list instead of waiting for the clip to fail first and discover the brand.
|OMAP4 does support GFX-destination color key and alpha-blend together.
Hence i removed this check as part of :
http://review.omapzoom.org/#change,14172
|if the upper level doesn't set isS3D to &quot;0&quot; properly, it might cause issue for OMAP3.
for OMAP4 i dont have any problem.
|why cant we just remove this dead code?
|I feel it is good idea to return from here instead of going further and failing in every check.
|same comment as above
|same comment as above
|why mono audio recording?
I see the normal camcorder also uses mono, but we can check with Audio team on why is this?
|what about Audio track in Flash usecase.
Will this metadata string check take care of audio as well??
ofcourse this nanowait is used under Ducati codec check, except one place which is under seek scenario. So It may not impact audio codec instance.
but just wanted to cross check.
|Sathya,

Are you sure we are getting TILER buffer of height &gt; 2048?
|it will be useful if appropriate error can be sent to user if the params are incorrect? this is required for debugging.
|dss checks in setOverlayinfo method becomes redundant as we already took care of window checks while arriving at the crop_to_rect.
We have to revisit the &quot;dss_check_overlay&quot; to see if we can remove some of the checks.
|I think we need to swap the out_width and out_height, not the input width &amp; height.
|why is this check for dis-&gt;enabled???
cant we get info for the display that is disabled?
|this is now should not be used
|Here we are considering even the ACTIVE overlays which are owned by the current display manager. Will it give the TRUE available overlay count!!!
|one macro taking the object and the second one taking simply pointer.
It is clean if the same signature is used in the both.
|does it mean any time we can have max of 3 compositions structures for a given manager queued from user side? or is it referring to max of 3 managers.
|Here this check of manager index against num_displays is valid only because managers are referred from the display indexes, right? otherwise platform can have only 1 display (HDTV) even though OMAP has 3 managers and may be manager1 (HDMI) is attached to TV.
|remove (unless forced)
|And != DISPLAYED
|This needs to be a while
|rotation and mirroring enums are missing.
|just wondering why is it signed varaible? what does the -ve co-ordinate refer to?
|what does this mean? width and height should be inverted right?
what is expected from user, inverted width &amp; height or the original one?
|I think this color format will be used along with ilace mode to handle interlaced videos, hence no interlaced format definition required. Am i correct?
|currently we are achieving the Horizontal mirroring by applying the
VFLIP first and then the rotation. The other way doesn't work.
Is it not the sequence imposed by DSS driver? is the current logic specific to V4L2?
|how can user define this? I feel this should be handled on the kernel side based on the HW scaling limits..
|I'm not clear on how can user arrive at these coefficients.
|Does it mean User has to keep track of Zorder for overlays on a given manager and adjust them as and when new overlays come in.
or can we query the zorder for the other overlays from this interface? and why is it tied with enable bit? there should be a means to enable/disable without touching the other fields also, right? is it just an optimization to combine these two controls into single variable, and it makes sense to just change zorder to hide &amp; show surfaces.
|i think this is what we extract from Gralloc handle?
|what is this default_color field?
|My understanding is that pipe line will be automatically disabled after one update, and needs to be re-enabled in the next posting.
If this is true, what do you mean by disable unused pipeline to avoid surprises?
|didn't understand sync_id completely.
Is it expected to be filled-in by the user? or is it internal to DSS COMP for identifying the composition structures?
|by user
|how is this manager window different from Overlay window we provide in setOverlyinfo.
|(1) If I understand correctly, this sync_obj logic demands multiple threads or poll logics on user side one for each display manager.
(2) and what happens if i use multiple overlays for the same display manager, but enabled in multiple IOCTLs? should i maintain multiple sync objects and wait on them?
|instead of hard coding, it is better to define constants
|defining constant is preferred over hardcoding
|it is good idea to leave a TBD here for this hardcoded resolution.
|If i understand correctly, we are initializing the picture size to default 640x480 here, instead of reading from xml.
May be we can add why we chose 640x480 and why we have to hardcode it here.
|We are reading the TV timings every time we do commit, provided panel is changed.

|Hi Anu, regarding your first comment above....
is this noffset not sufficient?
What other offset is missing?
|dump into SDCard doesn't seem to be possible because of permissions or so.

|This mSeekTimeUs is what the player asks for, but in case of AV playback, this time is updated to the video I-Frame time stamp.
We should seek audio also to the same Video frame time instead of player requested seek time.
|one ioctl can wait on only one buffer, because buffer info is the ioctl param.
Hence this wait is for each ioctl/buffer.
|No, state has to be reset only from dsscomp, once released from display.
|im going to fix it.
|Ruslan's point is read the critical variable outside if and use mutex protection only around that.
|irrespective of validate check, MUTEXED macro is going to access the 
second argument &quot;comp-&gt;ix&quot;.

the above check is to avoid the second dereference.
|good catch. I will correct.
|i didn't get the comment clearly, can you please add more details.
|I will correct it.
|I might need to dispatch the extra callback here, if one exists.
|yes, since the enum DSS_COMPLETION_ECLIPSED_SET has been removed along with callbacks, i wanted to give some error code for the client who asks for extra from composition.
|i thought the same as Lajos. No harm in calling refresh masks multiple times.
|This logic can be replaced with simple modulo (%) operator.
|What is the rational in maintaining the cloned buffers (TILER 1D buffers) with src manager ? Can't we associate them with the manager they are rendering to?
|Why do we need src manager ID??
|For HDMI (or any similar smart panel),  dssdev-&gt;state doesn't reflect the display state correctly. We have to check for :
if (dev-&gt;driver-&gt;smart_is_enabled)
			isDisplayEn = dev-&gt;driver-&gt;smart_is_enabled(dev);
|Hi Artem,
If the intent of this dss_check_state method is to check with HDMI is enabled or not, definitely this is not going to give the correct state,
You can check this method after boot up without attaching the HDMI cable, you will get as if HDMI is enabled. This is because of HDMI state m/c initialization.
|why to maintain suspend state per manager???
|This apply doesn't guarantee that it gets applied in HW, as we are not waiting for VSync here. And once we return from DSSCOMP suspend, DSS driver can shutdown everything immediately.
So, i believe this code is redundant.
|No need of maintaining suspend state per manager.
Suspend is for the entire device, which includes all drivers and HW peripherals.
|no need of maintaining suspend state per manager.
|But this optimization would make code look confusing with too many if/else combinations.
This is how we were doing on .35 kernel as well.
|I agree. I will irq = 0 in the beginning to take care of unsupported panels here.
|I feel this is a HACK, which may work for Suspend/resume scenario.
But what about normal playback scenario?
The overlay is commited from SurfaceFlinger process, even before Stagefright provides valid buffer pointers,

If the stream is enabled in commit itself, it can show any junk on screen.
|Why is the pipe line enabled without queuing the valid buffers?
It would cause screen artifacts or even faults.
|Hi Naren,
There are two reasons for using explicit index:
(1) OMX_ti_index.h on A9 domx headers is not updated with all the definitions on ducati side omx_ti_index.h header. Ofcourse this can be corrected by adding all the definitions on A9 side
(2) We need to define the same constant on Android Stagefright openmax header as well, where we dont want all the other custom indices, hence added a hardcoded index.
|yes.
|Hi Sarthak,

As we discussed yesterday, I need to hardcode some number in Stagfright header (if not 0x100, something else), hence i chose 0x100 offset. and also inorder to have sequential enums here, i need to put all the missing camera and other enums from Ducati side headers.
|OMX_TI_INTERLACEFORMATTYPE : Needs to be appended to every buffer with the format and timestamp.
But we are not supporting this as appending to every buffer is not supported by codec.

OMX_TI_INTERLACETYPE: possible formats

OMX_TI_DEINTERLACETYPE: This is to dictate OMX Component that it has to de-interlace. Currently codec doesn't support this.

OMX_TI_STREAMINTERLACEFORMATTYPE: Implemented currently.
|Hi Abhishek,

Sarthak has raised this point in his first review itself.
And we aligned to defer it as it is not a mandatory implementation for component.
Anyway our component doesn't support De-Interlacing.
|When i initially added this logic we didn't have utils file.
Now i can try to accommodate this logic there.
|since just for dumping frames, i didn;t make it component member.
Will make the change once i move this code to utils file.
|Entire file is using TABS, thats i made tabs.
|ok.
|the idea is to return immediately if oma.enhancement = false.
The return is added for this purpose only.
|the above one is not a new code, it is already present. 
because of alignment, the below added code is considered as existing and the above one as new.
|This is a constructor and couldn't have any returns without initializing the variables.
Hence i have protected the caller.
|so, do you suggest adding if true around complete function?
|what is mono type mean?, is it not one of the supported modes?
|Below one seems incorrect:
layout, &quot;SIDE_BY_SIDE_LR&quot;

is it a typo?
|Saket,

We can't push this to omap_dispc_unregister_isr, as it will cause dead lock if some one calls unregister from an ISR context.
We are calling it from apply_irq and completion_irq contexts and that lead to deadlock.
hence i had to add only in non-ISR cotexts.
|Since we are protecting the memory access, do we still need to allocate it on HEAP.
Can we not achieve the same with STACK Allocation as well.
|Can we free memory with spin lock held??
|Since it is an interface class, we have to add new method at the end of the class definition.
|change LOGE to LOGV
|you are right, there could be one or two which we have to discard, 
since we are freeing it in the port reconfiguration handling, we can;t allow them to be accessed by Client.
|Hi Saket,

Since the buffer state management is completely inside OMXCodec, AWesomePlayer can't do much.
|I don't think we need to do chmod explicitly.
If the sysFS definition on kernel gives the proper permissions, chown alone should be good enough.
|isn't 1080i = 1920x540?
why are we defining it as 1920x1080?
|Sorry, i didn't get what is meant by interlace field will occupy 1080 height window.
Field is only 540 lines height, right?
I think when configured for interlaced timings, HDMI will process only 540 lines (I mean the timings can do only 540 lines rendering).
I agree that it depends on how driver is interpreting this.
|Ok, fine.
We can redefine it if needed when we add the client for this.
|If i understand correctly, we are using the constant type on the TV side, as always sidebyside right? and the second case never gets satisfied.

If TV supports both of them, why are we not using?
|may be it is dumb question: Do we use two overlay pipes to render 3D content?
I was thinking that single overlay pipe with TV in interlaced/3D mode and render two fields with offset or whatever way it has been processed.
|I'm bit confused whether we are processing two layers or single layer of 3D content.
if single layer, the output window params can be reused, right?
|HWC_SKIP_LAYER check is redundant,
is_valid_layer takes care of this already.
|Can HWC set this Flag?
I thought this should be set only by SurfaceFlinger, and we have to just read it.
Only way to tell S.F that we don;t process is by leaving the compositionType to HWC_FRAMEBUFFER.
|since we can't have ix_docking and ix_s3d enabled at the same time,
Why can't we re-use ix_docking for S3D as well.
It seems you are also using the logic of largest surface, then where else is the difference?
|i feel this logic is redundant to what we have above,
this can be embedded in the above two cases, docking or cloning,
Am i missing something else???
|How do we handle thumbnail scenario?
We need to know the layout even for thumbnail generation, right?
|Does it mean we provide the same thumbnail buffer to the application?
and without doing color conversion?
|I like this approach.
I think both the options together would work.
Only requirement i see is, the buffer should be marked as with US.
Will give it a try and see how it behaves.
|Hi Saket,

This would cover only the messages received during the stop command execution and port flush execution. But what about the FBD/EBD received before the stop (before marking the ports as Shutting_Down.
|This is the tricky part, as i mentioned earlier, there are lot of scenarios we are hitting, and causing segfault. one of them is:

(1) Decoder is returning empty buffers without any error event
(2) OMXCodec is in STOP method, it changed the mstate = Executing_to_idle
and issued sendcommand to StateIdle
then waiting on a semaphore
(3) Then Decoder sent ERROR event, even before processing the stateChange Command.

(4) In this case the semaphore is signalled, since the component is in ERROR state, and completes the stop call even before component is moved to Idle.

(5) Then OMXCodec destructor comes, where FreeNode call thinks component is still in Execute state, so Initiate one more sendCommand to StateIdle.

(6) Here the SoftOMXComponent will segfault, because of redundant calls to same state transition.
|I agree with you, it is just a port Index difference.
|Yes, we hit this scenario in#
OMXCodec is in the execution of &quot;stop()&quot; method, it has issued the IdleState change, but it didn't wait till state transition is done, because of ERROR event.
Then it tries to free the Node, and comes here.

The Stop and free are happening so fast that even before OMX Component has executed the state change we are issuing two stateChange Commands.

this is happening for some clips.
|I don't think so.
I have considered a scenario, where Client (OMXCodec.cpp) didn't send any Idle state transition, meaning when there is no redundant commands.
this is only a safe side loop to make sure on going transitions are done.
But we can't assume any state at the end of the loop.
It could be either Executing or Idle.
|Hi Illia,

I fully agree with your comment. In that scenario, it guarantees that COMPONENT really went into badstate, as it failed to finish the transition in 1sec.

Hence it maybe ok to generate segfault and recover.
|this entire function is under omap enhancement check.
please loot at line#186.
|Hi Gus,

only for width downscale limits we need special handling if pclk is zero.
|The current design uses mirror and dock capability checks to decide whether ext is on or not. But i would prefer to check whether ext is enabled, then go for capability checks.
In order to support run time change of the setprops, the setprops will be read and maintained everytime, hence they can't reflect the ext status. Setprop can be still set without enabling the external. Our code should just skip processing those props till TV is connected.

|No.
Since the correct place to add this logic already had OMAP_ENHANCEMENT, our original patch didn't have to add macro again. Thats why no macro in the original patch.
And when it is applied in a wrong place..... it happened because of git super intelligence, hence we can't comment on why it did it this way :)
|Jean,
This is not the Code from Google. 
When we applied MR0 patch on MR1, the logic has been applied at wrong location.
This is what the code we wanted to add, but at a different function.
|Where is this made read-only? on Ducati side??
If so, should we change on Ducati side to accept it from Stagefright.

It may lead to some issues, if we don't communicate this to Ducati.
|If we are going to use Allocate buffer on i/p port, what is recommendation in OMX IL spec?

|how did we comeup with 20msec??
are there any scenarios where the gap between two msgs from OMX component are &gt; 20msec?? I think in the case where no msg within 20msec, it will enter into while loop again and acts as polling logic, right?
|Hi Mark,

I'm not sure whether this is needed. atleast in pthread-timers.c (which i have used for reference), they are not locking for wait call.
|My understanding is that, port reconfiguration with resolution change will update the outputformat metadata with new width and height and then control comes to AwesomePlayer. Does this patch address the clips that trigger port reconfig with the new width and height as well??
|what happens to clips that trigger port reconfiguration because of container??
may be we end up using the old values here.
We can move this logic to &quot;notifyVideoSize_l()&quot;.
|This is required if the phone is portrait, but our Blaze is still a landscape UI eventhough it is built for smart phone configuration.

|Do we consider the TIMER overflow/roundup scenario? may be we just don't enter into any of the above &quot;if&quot; conditions, hence we don't wait for that iteration, or how many such iterations??

white space correction.
|May be you can use MIN, MAX macros to simplify the code.
|same as above
|the argument &quot;container&quot; is no where used??
|what is the difference between swaps2D and tiler_swap?
|here scaling /non scaling is not just for HDMI. even for LCD if we have only 2 layers in the composition list, and both of them need scaling, then nonscaling overlays number is important.
and since the code is generic about the number of non-scaling DSS pipes, this logic is needed.
|Please add omap enhancement checks
|im wondering why do we need libandroid_runtime and libgui here.
|better to use LOCAL_PATH variable instead of the complete folder structure.
|The intention of making constructor private and exporting instantiate function is to make sure it is singleton. If this is the case, we should check for gDSSWBHal pointer before going ahead with &quot;new&quot;.

If it is designed to work for multiple instances then, no point is making the constructor private and adding one more method for instantiation.
|this buffer state is slightly confusing.
At this point the buffer has not been captured yet, it is given for capturing.
It may be more meaningful to change the state to captured on DSSCOMP callback.

Am i missing anything here?
|missing Mutex lock while modifying the captured/dequeue list.
|we can use random number with a unique seed.
|what about unregistering the already registered buffers?
Is the client expected to release the WB session on this error??
|same comment as above.
|having lock with timeout is suggested for graceful exit.
|after waiting forever to get atleast 1 dequeue buffer available, checking for mDequeueCancelled is not fitting well in the sequence.
|(1) don't we need color format as configurable option, if someone wants to capture RGB data directly? so that it can be extended for screen-capture usecase as well.

(2) similarly adding time stamp may be required for A/V sync logic right?
|is this cancel buffer is to return the buffers back to free pool? if so why is bufIndex a pointer?
|why there is no wbHandle provided to this method?
|dequeue is supposed to be a blocking call, then what does cancelDequeue do?
|If you are referring to line : HARDWARE_TI_OMAP_BASE/ion 
I have already fixed it in another patch.
|better to use LOCAL_PATH variable instead of giving absolute path.

|can we not reuse the uevent library from android (i'm referring to uevent.c implementation from android), if at all any reuse.
|what happens if get_wfd_descriptor() gets called multiple times? we should have a check.

|when will this condition be true??
|didn't understand when this check will be true.
|same as above.
|In this case the exclusive layer is expected to be rendered to LCD right. Then the layer attributes should not be altered.
|unless the WFD is in connected state, the layers would be rendered on LCD, hence it is required to check for WFD state as well.
|since setup docking is called only for the primary dockable layer, when the smallest of dockable &amp; exclusive is the protected one, we will miss this logic.
|instead of having this check everywhere, can we make the appropriate fields modified (after taking backup if required, as we have to comeback to hdmi mode) whenever WFD is setup.

Are these modes expected to be controlled from app by explicitly setting the props??
|what is expected from SurfaceFlinger with this notification?
Is it a part of back-ground layer support??
|My assumption of EXCLUSIVE LAYER is that Surface Flinger would post of them irrespective of the external display (whether present or not) and they are expected to be routed to either LCD or external display based on the ext display state.

|did you consider all scenarios where we may call dequeue without actually queing it especially during on/off or some other corner case. Im bringing this because, even in OMXCodec.cpp we had to modify lot of CHECK calls to if/else loops to exit gracefully instead of faulting.
|Needs to protect the below section of code :
while checking mRegistered and registering the buffers
|but defining explicit enums would really help to understand the codeflow. you can follow the same way you defined functions.
|thanks.
|good description about the enums. otherwise it would have been impossible to understand the flow.

But how about explicitly defining the state names like: MediaSourceQueued
MSDequeued
CD_Queued
CD_Dequeued etc
Anyway you have declred different methods for each q/dq
similarly we can have enums as well
|when request buffer fails, we should reset the buffer state to FREE, as this is the only appropriate state i see.
|we are not calling shutdown from here , meaning we rely on the client to shut it down on error cases.
This assumption may not be good., so lets free them explicitly from here.
|my suggestion is to change the buffer state on failure before returning error, to reflect the correct buffer state all the time.,
|this means that we are going ahead with CANCELED_FROM_CD buffers? then we dont need this cancelled state at all.
|im fine with not faulting here.
But my question is more from the need for CANCELED state.
|should we not explicitly cancel the minUndequeuedBuffers to SMS??
|not in case of error. I'm referring to the start condition. When we dequeue the buffers, we are dequeueing only the kInitialQueuedBuffers count, but leaving the minUndequeued.
My point is that we need to explicitly cancel those minUndequeued buffers.
|I have another question here. Does BufferQueue allocate the actual buffer without dequeuing it ?
So, im thinking may be we should Dequeue all the buffers (so that they get allocated from Gralloc, and then Cancel the minUndequeued to free them and return them to SMS.

Now, may be we are deferring the  buffer allocation for those minUndequeued buffers till we dequeue them later in the sequence.
|there is no actual DEQUEUE happening. is it just for the state update??
|i feel it should be ok, because during this interval buffer is in QUEUED_TO_CD state and we dont do any major stuff when it is in this state.
|this seems redundant to DEQUEUED_FROM_CD.
since in both the cases the buffer owner ship is changing from CD to CS, can we not handle it internally.
Only difference is in dequeued case we queue it to SMS where as in the cancelled case we kind of free it, right?
|but we are queuing it to SMS with a warning statement.
What do we do with those buffers then? should we free them?
when do you cancel the buffer?
I see we cancel the buufers
(1) When we tear down the capture
(2) When we change the resolution as part of AV format change (if we add that support in WB HAL as well).

In both the cases we can very well live with DEQUEUE and stop and everything, right?

Am I missing any other usage you have in mind?
|i think we should ignore those buffers in queueMediaSourceBuffer(). then it make sense to have this state explicitly.
|since the WB captured buffers are already queued with SurfaceMediaSource, shouldn't repeater source interact with surfacemediasource buffer queue.
Am i missing something fundamental?
|Can we move this declaration to common file?
|need to free up gDSSWBHal memory.
|I think we can search for surface flinger service and connect to it.
|can we not add our own IDSSWBHAL binder to the existing service, why to extend the existing binder interface?
|is DSSWB still a new service in the current Architecture?
Or is it just a shared library?
|writeback list seems to be the list of buffer that are with Writeback but not yet captured, right?  how often processQueue gets called from wb_capture thread?? if it calls after each capture done, then there may be only one buffer in the queue at any time, right?
|Capture DONE seems to be more appropriate if the Dequeue list is for the MediaServer to dequeue the captured buffer.
|shouldn't this call be buffer specific, like whether a particular buffer is not filled yet !!!

or the state of mWritebackList , to see if there is anything in this list which is under capture operation.
|do we really need this register/unregister??
Anyway buffers are being allocated from Surface Flinger process, and now WB is part of SurfaceFlinger process.
|what about AV format change support? Don't we support resolution change? could be a TODO item here.
|when can the last check be TRUE?
if the scenario is before register or after unregister, that should be taken care by the second check.
|yes.
|does it mean today Client would get blocked if there are no screen updates? then how does Repeater source behave?
If repeater source is also blocked, this is interesting, otherwise i was thinking that we should add that logic in repeater source to not to repeat the frames for the static screen scenarios.
|conditional wait lock would be preferred as Capture involves HW Activity which could hang.
|is the assumption that we cancel the oldest of the queued buffer? but not any arbitrary buffer index that client can specify?
|The the buffer state should be marked as FREE, why are marking it as DEQUEUED?
|ok.
|should add the buffer to Dequeue list here.
|it is standard in android to name locked functions same as the original one with _l. eg: getConfig_l
|this dead code can be removed.
|what is the idea of providing the bufIndex in register? is it for the subsequent queue/dequeue calls?

We can achieve the same by we providing the bufIndex in return to the user.
|we can achieve the FREE state by checking for whether slot has valid buffer or not.
|lets follow Android naming scheme for locked methods (use _l)
|im also thinking the same,
but would like to check with someone managing this S3D part of code.
|there are two options#
(1) move these legacy functions under S3D macro.
(2) remove docking code under S3D macro as well, and we can add it on top of multiple display code.
|on HDMI unplug we remove the display, hence config doesn't even exist.
|i didn't quite get the comment for docking mode? we can't have cloning without actually having the external display.

btw, do we really need this reset??
during display alloc, anyway everything is set to ZERO. and after that on everymode mode change, we are setting the best_mode in which mode and panel width/height are updated. Do you see any scenario where we have to explicitly reset these members?
|As i mentioned earlier, my initial thought was to have generic discovery code to detect any time of display (physical or virtual).
If you are going add virtual display detection in a different file, i will rename it.
|this is carried from the original version.
|ok.
|Yes, this is required. otherwise the uninitialized variable would be used in overlay allocation and were causing weird behavior.
|since we inter this method after checking the device channel type check, it should guarantee that HDMI is connected.
|there is no harm in setting the best mode here.
Ofcourse it would be redundant when we get hotplug event.
But it is logical to set mode as well in int init method.
|for primary hdmi display, we needn't check ext display flag.
And hotplug may not even be mandatory for primary hdmi devices.
|what i mean is, even without ext_disp variable being set we call init_primary_hdmi_display. because inside hwc.c device_open() we init primary display before starting the hdmi thread.
And for me hwc_dev-&gt;ext_disp_state and hwc_dev-&gt;ext_last_ovls make sense only for EXTERNAL DISPLAY, not for primary, even though hdmi is primary.
|Yes you are right. ok, then i would remove call from here instead of adding the check for ext_disp_state which i dont feel relevant to be here.
|this space formatting is corrected in the next patch.
|i agree. instead of new method i will move it to setup_hdmi_config()
|sure :)
|i agree.
|i thought it may be good to have an explicit field so that it is easy for future extensions like on board secondary display (eg: similar to what we have on blaze).
Since it is just a 32-bit field, i would retain it.
|:) i was expecting this comment.
Will make the change.
|copy/paste error.
will correct it. As i mentioned in the patch description mode change is not supported in this patch, hence this error is not caught. thanks for pointing this.
|for now since we are not changing the mode, it is okay.
But i agree with you, and im thinking about the same on what happens to SF when we switch modes for mirror and distinct scenarios.
|As i mentioned earlier this patch doesn't support mode change.
And coming to the mode change support approach... im thinking of using last_mode &amp; current_mode fields.
But anyway its too early for me to comment on this, still working on it. Lets syncup via mails.
|ok.
|i need this to get &quot;ext&quot;.
for WFD, there should be else case and extract &quot;ext&quot; from external_wfd_display_t.
|ok.
|it can enter here even without mirroring, if hwc_dev-&gt;last_ext_ovls is non ZERO. this happens during transition from HDMI ON to HDMI OFF state.
|if the display discovery is not based on reading its properties eg: virtual displays, it may be more relevant to have the discovery logic inside hwc.c rather than display.c
|My idea is to make the code open for extension in the future without modifying the existing code too much.
But its a valid point for discussion and optimization.
|ok.
|The reason for not extending the base config is because, we are using base config params to communicate display cfg attribs to surface flinger but these new attribs are very much internal.
|I wanted to access xres/yres/fps.....
ofcourse we can access them via display-&gt;base.config
but when we want to keep track of last config and current config while switching from mirroring to distinct mode, we need xres/yres to be part of ext display cfg which is the one maintained for last and current.
|if we introduce docking support the, there will be difference:
cloning LCD to HDMI either in
mirroring mode
or in docking mode
|This last config is required when we switch HDMI config between mirroring and distinct content mode.
like we did between mirroring and docking.
|only width and height are not changed, but the transform and mirror can change across multiple compositions. And regarding the naming since the data type is of config we needn't add _config for the members.
|Hi Mykola,

I'm not checking for content resolution, if content means the layer source crop value.
I'm not referring to the docking mode where there is only single layer.

My idea is... for eg to Switch between 1080p and 720p for distinct and mirror modes, i need to keep track of HDMI resolution but not the content. Ofcourse we can keep track of HDMI mode to decide this, but HDMI resolution is what i wanted to keep track because different modes can have the same resolution with other attributes changed.
|yes. while switching between mirroring and distinct mode, i need to know xres/yres.
|i agree. thats why wanted to test HDMI as primary display option and make sure this one co-exists with external display.
|we should consider the transition state when hdmi is attached and detached. All the overlays used earlier on HDMI should be first disabled and then used for LCD. anyway this logic has been changed in the next patch.
|since this is logically correct and its going to be changed in the multiple display patch, i would leave it like this.
|yes, corrected it in the next patch.
|this is not wrong...it is just a redundant check :)
anyway will correct it.
|will check.
|already corrected in the next patch.
|will check.
|This is used in display.c
|i had the same opinion.
i left all the dangling params in the device struct.
|we need this even in display.c
|does it mean we always have ~145ms AV sync difference?
Is there anyway in the spec to communicate the startup delay to the sink?
|ok, from the description when you say frame, i thought it is just for Video frame processing. So, you are saying that 145msec delay is the static delay from source to sink through out the session.
|ok.
|will correct.
|ok.
|ok.
|swap_rb is not applicable for hdmi, let me reset this field to ZERO for external composition.
|will correct it.
|The above one will yield the same result.
|will correct it.
I just overlooked the boolean operation with the actual value.
Thanks for pointing this out.
|already done that as part of multiple display patch.
Infact i purposefully deferred it till the multiple display patch where this change would be more relevant.
|When i have two display support, i can put it under allocate display and it gets executed for both.
|understand this is a redundant check.
will remove.
|yes. But i remember the earlier implementation of is_valid_layer, but i missed that even FB_TARGET is added there. hence added explicit check here.
|i overlooked cloning onto Virtual displays.
will correct it.
|Here my idea is that if the layer is on TV only if HDMI is primary display or external display distinct or cloning.

I think you are bringing out a scenario of HDMI being priamary and cloning. Do we have HDMI as primary display and the layer getting cloned onto virtual display scenario???
|to start with i'm splitting all resources equally between two displays if the external display is not in legacy mode.
We have to yet to implement an intelligent way of assigning resource like overlays and tiler1d space.
Will be added as a separate patch once the functionality is supported.
|thanks for pointing this. since this EXT DISP NON LEGACY MODE is not yet tested, this bug is left uncaught. Will correct.
|this offset is initialized only for EXTERNAL DISPLAY and display is not in legacy mode.
so, for the PRIMARY DISPLAY, control never comes here.
|it will be ZERO for the primary display.
It is updated to the previously used overlay count for the subsequent displays. currently i added logic for HDMI External display.
|even in K3.0 we need to post dummy comp to correct the data structures at dsscomp level.
|Are you referring to the new mechanism we are going to implement in dsscomp?
Otherwise, with the current implementation, we need to explicitly post dummy comp for external display to disable all its overlays.
|Noticed it during patch sumbission, will correct it.
|You are correct. This is redundant assignment.
will correct it.
|thanks for pointing this out.
I had this when i tested with hotplug propagation patch but missed during testing on mainline. will correct it.
|Yes, in DSS Hardware we can configure any overlay to any manager.. But the static assignment is coming from OMAPFB, where during the init, it will query overlay from DSS and configures the manager and rest with the FB info.
Since anyway during rendering we dont use omapfb path, may be we can override that, but i'm not sure about the consequences of overriding the omapfb configuration. And in order to move it from hdmi to lcd, may be i need to post dummy comp on hdmi??
|This is required, because FB1 configures VID1 for HDMI.
So, when we have distinct compositions, we have to have VID1 for FB1/HDMI.

I understand the complexity in handling this, but i dont see any other way. because changing the kernel is not a good idea for this.
|I have done the similar thing.
To enter the loop, i have the offset and i use increment field to arrive at the subsequent indices. will see if i can further simplify it.
|ok.
|ok
|We are going to have sequential allocation of overlays.
In this context ovl_inc is not needed, but still i left it so that if we  decide to go for different scheme, then it will be used.
and coming 
dsscomp-&gt;ovls[dsscomp-&gt;num_ovls].cfg.mgr_ix = ovl_ix

I think you meant cfg.ix , not mgr_ix right?
And ovl_ix = GFX is not valid all the time because if we have use_sgx = true, then our first ovl = VID1, GFX can't be used in the loop.

I think the current logic handles all these scenarios, is there anything missing?
|no harm in assigning VID3 or VID2 to TV manager.
I just left it so that it will be generic for both the displays.
|Since we open FB HAL before creating hwcomposer, we need to at least cache gralloc handle to retrieve fb devices later.
shall we move gralloc open to later point in the code execution?
|Yes, this is what Android mandates for HWC1.1 and ofcourse you workarounded that in HWComposer.cpp :)
I would leave this logic as current, and revisit as part of FB HAL control from HWC.
|since the functionality is to reserve overlays for each of the displays, i named it this way.
|my understanding is that display.c is meant for controlling display specific settings, And the general algo should be in the main file.
|this is to handle compositions for external display. 
If the layer is for external display and if the external display is HDMI---&gt; then we need to check for all the constraints applicable for TV.
|i dont think i got your comment correctly.
Lets discuss.
|This will not result in false positives. Instead, it will exhaust TILER1D space for the first display and worst case it will not allow any layer acceleration for the external display.
|In the earlier code base we used to increment mem1D requirement in this check itself. I'm still in that mind set. realized that we already accumulated it during stats collection.
Will correct it.
|use_sgx is set if DSS can't handle all the layers for a particular display. this could be different for different displays.
|This is to not to trigger this logic for primary display.
But since i have corrected the get_display_mode method to return PRESENTATION_MODE for primary display, yes i can remove is_hdmi check from here.
|why do you say that?
IF the DDK team is going to provide Post2 interface per display, then the below logic can equally be used for second display.
|as per your previous comment, we need to have a mechanism to handle hdmi as the default display and make use of all the attributes of the external display.
|here primary_transform (the original name from the previous code), refers to the scaling transform for FB, but not the layer.
This would anyway reduce the number of overlays by 1 in the reserve overlays method. so here we have to offset by 1 to make sure that VID1 is reserved for FB if there is needs_fb.
|missing OMAP_ENHACEMENT check
|so, please add a comment explicitly.
And if this is a bug we can target to push to google tree, though Android is not supporting AVI officially.
|is this the bug in original code?
|Do not change the exisitng method.
Instead add another constructor for not hardcoding PCM audio.
|OMAP_ENAHNCEMENT flag missing.
|what happened to this logic?
|we may unlock this mutex twice if we break from line#643.
is this fine?
|what do you mean by valid native resolution. i thought both source and sink would publish their Native resolutions. if that is not the case, if they negotiate with default resolution of 640x480, then my suggestion may not be useful.
|I have just one query#
This is not a spec requirement, right.

if the source and sink are at different native resolutions, earlier we were sending source native resolution and sink used to do scaling, now we are scaling on the source side itself.

My suggestion is.. instead of hardcoding whether to respect sink or source native resolution, we can see which native resolution is the best to reduce the network payload.
eg: if (source_native_resolution &gt; sink_native_resolution)
         best_vid_mode = sink_native_resolution
//so that we downscale first and then send out on n/w
 else
         bast_mode = source_native_resolution
//so that the upscale happens on the sink side
|do you have any high level changes needed.
|sorry i dont have the exact change list when i made the suggestion, hence would like to see the amount of changes of required and then push for my idea. btw, if there are many unknowns (unknown side effects) at SF, lets stick to the current approach and anyway HWC1.2 would change all these.
|can we not have the virtual display info as part of hwc/display.c and expose through getDisplayConfig std interface? This makes easy to create FrameBufferSurface as well.
For that we need to be able to query VFBStub props from hwc, which may not be straight forward, but is it impossible??
|instead of adding ifdef checks everywhere can we extend the HWC_NUM_DISPLAY_TYPES to consider virtual displays as well, so that rest of hwcomposer.cpp should work straight away wrt these checks.
|shouldn't it be of separate type:
external_wfd_display
{
display_t wfd;
external_display ext;
}

because we need external role for mirroring and other controls.
|I expect external_wfd_display struct for WFD support.
|if one of the displays prepare fails, do we want to skip all the subsequent displays??
|If one display set fails, Why should we skip set for all the subsequent displays??
|i agree with Mykola. Lets not add ifdef for arguments, instead put a new function.
|why is 192? why not 254?
|it would be good if all TI additions are contiguous.
|okay, i will do it for hal_public.h inside omap4xxx/hwc as part of other changes.
|we need to define this hal_public.h as well, to be visible in ddk build.
|OMAP_ENHANCEMENT is missing here, would break builds for platforms without OMAP_ENHANCEMENT macro
|The idea is to minimize Android changes as much as possible.
If it is vendor specific formats, we should hide them inside HAL components, and for that matter all the FW changes need to be justified to be only in Android framework but not in HAL.
|Mykola,

do you think we have to use these in any frameworks component. So far we are using only at HAL level, if that is the case, lets define them at HAL level header only.
If we are accessing it in frameworks, this is required.
|yes
|why did you remove the protected layer check?
We need to check for protected layer to make sure we have a dedicated overlay for this in the primary as well as ext compositions.
|My understanding is that &quot;ch&quot; is the DSS CHANNEL index whereas, mgr_ix is the array index inside d-&gt;mgr structure.

Seems you have modified this notion, so, please add some description on what is what.
|where is this &quot;_multi&quot; coming from?
This was done in my temporary patch and we decided to abandon that, right?
|i dont call it a HACK.
This is a policy for dual display.
And blitter support for dual display will be a separate task, so please change the description appropriately.
|didn't get the intention of this TODO here.
if not the same aspect ratio, we can apply transform on WB path, right?
|inside setup_wb_capture method, what is expected if we dont use wb? what for is this else part?
|change this check to
if (layer-&gt;compositionType == HWC_FRAMEBUFFER_TARGET)
 continue;
|we execute this logic twice for presentation mode.
we can optimize this separately for legacy and presentation modes.
|i think you were already working on patch for switch between SGX/WB?
|what happens if the layer stack is not same.
I feel the check should be otherway, enable WB only if both the stacks are same, else rely on SGX composition.
|do you want to check for both disp mode as well as is mirroring?
Since we have only mirroring in legacy mode, and also legacy mode may not be very intuitive here, i thought is_mirroring should replace all legacy mode checks.
|I remember S3D team using LCD2 manager for composition in case of WB mem-mem mode. So i was thinking we adopted the same for WFD as well. but didn;t know that you were using HDMI manager for WFD WB scenario. Do we have any plan for 2K+ panels... i dont know. But anyway let us keep the same ICS design and document it somewhere.
|Does it mean, we use the manager1 (which is connected to HDMI at the DSS HW level) to do the composition for Virtual display? was the design based on the assumption that HDMI and WFD is not ON simultaneously??
|needs rebasing on top of the latest code base, where this logic is chnaged.
|is it just for display ID? or do you expect this mgr_ix to control the DSS manager selection?
|same comment as above.
|i would expect else part of this check for WFD display.
and extract ext from external_wfd_display.
Ofcourse the actual implementation of mirroring logic is entire different b/w physical and virtual displays, but at least the state variables can be reused, right?
|manager index is confusing with the definition on kernel side.
Lets call it display_id or display_device_id.
|we need the params for virtual display here.
|dont we need to check for virtual display here?
|remove white space.
|can we use the same semaphore for both the slots?
btw, i think both the slots will be pinned/unpinned together as part of the same composition, hence we may not need semaphore check here. do you really need this?
|split_slots and merge_slots seems more readable forms.
|unpin might have already happened in the callback, right?
We shouldn't touch the slot that is currently with DSS.
|not needed
|not needed
|these prints are not needed by default.
|we dont need these prints by default.
|Since the DDK is same across ICS/JB MR0/JB MR1 programs, we are still using this on ICS, hence can't be removed.
|since DDK is using PRIVATE2 for EXCLUSIVE_DISP, we should use PRIVATE3 here.
|i feel db itself says it is a list and plural.
|i have the same opinion. I tried holding just the &quot;best&quot; (instead of ~best) inside current mode, then realized that the two's complement is done to consider ZERO mode as well it seems.
but i'm not dare to change that entire logic now.
|i will do this as part of mode change support, where we call set_best_hdmi_mode multiple times.
|i will check.
|i would prefer light weight dynamic reconfigure rather than codec re-creation.
|why is FPS required as part of setipVideDecoder?
We should make it via setParam, so that it can be used for dynamic fps change during AV format change.
|move this inside else part where we are using it.
|this is a critical bug, please push it to Google master, and provide the patch ID here.
|why to modify the &quot;0&quot; slot?
and even we are not restoring it. lets use local variable for overlay and then do all operations on that.
|does it mean there should be a connected display to the manager to enter into this logic?
|dont use &quot;0&quot; slot of ofbi-&gt;overlays.
|why are we not setting transform.scaling here??
|yes, i corrected it in one of my patches. okay then lets defer it till my patch is merged.
|do we need this region argument??
we can use the display-&gt;transform.region as the source region and cfg/video mode as the destination.
|dont we need to stick to only the mirroring region?
|Yes we can call ioctl with invalid fd, and it will return error saying bad file descriptor (EBADF), but lets avoid the call by checking here.
|since virtual displays will have invalid fb_fd, this method would fail and return error. May be i need to add check for valid fb_fd before making the ioctl, otherwise the caller would receive the error from ioctl.
|Oops..., i will correct it.
|good point. we can reuse device close here.
|this is not needed.
|I agree with you. but is_composable is so generic that it gave me an impression that we are checking for handle validity.
hence added _hw. because initially this is_valid_layer was added just to check for SKIP flag and handle != NULL checks, then extended later.
|hmmm.... ok i will rename the method.
|because the HW scaling capabilities are different for different displays.
|yes, i know this. This hierarchy works when the current level doesn't refer to any of the top levels, meaning if non of the layer functions refer to display. But since layer validation is dependent on display type, i need to add this. The other option i see is extracting the display specific attributes in display.c and pass them as arguments to below layers. For now it works if i pass the channel information, whether it is DIGITAL or LCD. 

what do you say?
|if we want to stick to the hierarchy, only option i see is increasing the argument list in the calls?
i prefer passing disp rather than adding arguments as we add functionality.

+1 from me for passing disp id.
what about you?
|have to make &quot;disp&quot; as second argument for consistency.
|i prerfer : can_dss_scale
|i still prefer can_dss_render_layer, as we are checking for DSS HW caps.
dsscomp is just a framework piece.
|i still prefer can_dss_render_layer, as we are checking for DSS HW caps.
dsscomp is just a framework piece.
|if we want to keep user side definitions in sync with kernel, then everything should be referred as dsscomp (no &quot;_&quot; inbetween).

(1) dsscomp.[ch] --&gt; dss_comp.[ch]
dsscomp_state_t --&gt; dss_composer_t
init_dsscomp() --&gt; init_dss_composer()
--&gt; dsscomp is more intuitive based on kernel data structures, but dss_composer is also correct from meaning point of view.

(2) hwc_dev.dsscomp --&gt; hwc_dev.dss
--&gt; i think it should be dsscomp only, because hwc sees only dsscomp interface, not the dss2 driver interface.
|lets not bring DSSCOMP in any Hardware related attributes.
dsscomp is a s/w framework
|this _info is not aligned with our vision of all these display_t, hdmi_t, external_t and primary_t.

if we want to add methods to get the objects, then we need to do the same for external as well.
does it qualify for a method?
|okay, lets revisit this for individual display's force sgx functionality.
|the reason i left it inside set_for_display was to enhance this to support force_sgx per display.
the usecase would be like.... primary display being just a touch pad and small pointer, and external display being the main rendering panel. in that case we can force primary for sgx comp, but the external would be hw accelerated. defered it till next release as there are other tasks pending,
|im not asking about the correction.
My question was, why is this change as part of this patch??
|why is this changed as part of this patch?
|not yet. Infact I had this patch last week itself but because of some pending issues, it was kept on postponing to push to gerrit. yet to rebase on the latest patches.
|do you mean using presentation instead on distinct mode?
|Yes, distinct means presentation mode, and since application can't selectively duplicate the layers into two display stacks, i think we can achieve docking only by our legacy mode support.
|when i say docking, i'm referring to legacy mode docking based on EXTERNAL_DISP usage flag.
|if it is all over the file, lets take up for next release.
list down in our nice to have items list.
|so far.. yes.
Do you see any dispaly, where portrait mode is meaningful?
|i pushed this patchset as soon as the mode change is working.
Already working on patchset#2 for such cleanups.
|you are correct. already made that change.
|i have to rebase this patch on top wfd patches.
|dont we need this for WFD?
i thought inside this check we will have
if(hdmi)

else if (wfd)

kind of logic.
|Initially i thought the same, but backed if off later thinking this legacy/presentation makes sense only for the secondary displays. Primary display will always be in the presentation mode. And i also need last_mode variable. do you think even last_mode fit inside display_t?
|yeah, infact i tried to have only one time get_display_mode call, and rest all referring to current_disp_mode.
trying to achieve this in the next patchset.
|yes, i'm removing this get prop this init and even the below setup_mirror/distinct mode logic.
|removing this setup logic completely in my patchset2
|will do.
|hmmm.... may be set_display_contents() would become too heavy. anyway i feel this is the appropriate place to set the display transformation matrix.
|i agree. but adding role is more intuitive than adding disp id, right? unless there is strong reason why we need to provide only disp id, i would prefer role
|from the API definition point of view role makes more sense, because it is initializing hdmi in primary or external role.
|hmmm... we can do that.
i wanted to avaoid get props from display.c (which we initially added for display specific configuration). but I already moved mirroring region get prop to display. We can move this as well if we feel there wont be any such config here in future.
|Since it is decided based on the primary device resolution, and kind of single time decision for a given product, i thought primary info would be the appropriate one.

Are you planning to change mirror region dynamically for WFD?
|will correct.
|:)

its becoming longer.
And I'm so much used to earlier naming of mirror.enabled, mirror.rotation etc.
I think mirror_region should be okay.
|i thought it is more convenient if we have the names here, but i agree with you regarding the future updates.
|did't get your comment.
|ok.
|what do you mean by Done? are you pushing one more patchset?
|missing OMAP_ENHANCEMENT macro check
|in that case, generally the header will have TI license right?
has this file been taken from some Opensource project?
thats why we can't append TI license there???
|thanks for the details.

Please mention the scenarios tested/supported with this feature.
adding this in the patch description is more useful.
|instead of just recreate/reconfiguring the encoder, why are we recreating the session?
what is the latency involved in this?
This one unnecessarily tears down the Audio encoder as well.

if we recreate just the video encoder, we can optimize it by not re-allocating buffers, and just cropping them etc.
|spelling# WB_DONE
|ok,.
|but can we release without first unpinning,
We discussed this in the call, and decided to unpin before releasing, right?
|do you mean, once we report RESPONSE_OK for RTSP msg, source would change the format and set the MPEG2TS discontinuity bit, so that sink will automatically handle the format change on the next packet?
|packet loss may not be acceptable as we could loose I-frame.
ok, lets discuss offline.
|thanks. but what about handling discontinuity bit on our sink side?
are we planning to add this support?
|we are just updating the mVideoMode here, but what triggers the new mode to take effect?
|since there is no format change support for audio, do we still need audio mode here??
|why is the check for mNumDeqeued?
if there was one buffer dequeued, do we want to wait till that buffer is processed? if so, then what about the case where multiple buffers were dequeued?
|the status of presentation_mode variable is undefined if there is only LCD, lets initialize this to false in the beginning  of gralloc_queue or set it to false here for else case instead of checking for num_mgrs == 2
|we need OMAP_ENHANCEMENT check.
|doesn't mgr_apply return error when it is called on an INACTIVE manager??
|we are using fbnum only in print? do we still need this?
|add comment mentioning the assumptions for these sizes
|ok, but it looks weird to define two device structures even for those products just with single display.
lets see if we can exit gracefully from SF without faulting.
|when hdmi is the default display, what is the second device?
when there is no device, do we need to explicitly define these params??
|I'm referring to the products where we have only one display device, that is HDMI. in that case, the first FB creation request from SF should be for HDMI. when you say SF will fail to start, does it mean it creates the second FB on hotplug? and switches the FBTarget surface from first to second and first becomes dummy in this case?
|does it mean, it will always allocate swap chain for the second device? can we not control it based on the board file configuration?
|dont we have return values for any of those above methods?
|since we are checking for OMAP_DSS_GFX explicitly, we dont need check for primary display.
|it seems when we have both videos and images, we dont display images. can we display images along with videos?
|remove tabs.
|it would be better if you could add some more description about the patch. What was missing and what has been added in this patch etc.
|why cant we directly populate audio/videoBitrate?
|is it during playing a Video or while accessing TILER2D from DSS and GC320 being active simultaneously?
Im not clear about the issue statement.
|please make sure patch#32039 rebases on top of this and adds instrumentation for these cases.
|my point is that# 
(1) In the current codebase since we are not enabling blitter even for primary display in case of multi display scenario, the above logic is slightly confusing, but combing both checks look good.
(2) When we resolve the blitter issues and enable for both the displays, we dont need this primary display check. so i thought adding check in one place, checking for multiple display or not is good enough.
|can you verify that combination# ext in presentation + primary with blitter enabled
|i feel this check is dummy.
Since we are checking this method along with blit_layers, where we return error if there is any external display.

so, we can very well return blit policy directly here.
|if (disp == PRIMARY &amp;&amp; get_external_display_id(hwc_dev) &lt; 0)
in this check, isn't the disp==PRIMARY check redundant/dummy?
|Please check with Archit or Tomy to know why it was removed in K3.0
|I think in K3.0 early suspend was removed. Why are we adding it back?
|but dsscomp suspends all the active displays.
do we still need dss driver level suspend/resume.
|ok, But i remember we need to set only selective pipes to high priority along with MFlag. ex: if there is an UF on GFX pipe then we need to set high priority only on GFX pipe.
I didn't understand the reason for setting all the pipes to high priority. it will be as good as having all the pipes at low priority right?
|why are we enabling it if there is no MFLAG?
it should not be &quot;else if&quot;
|this is a temp version till we get the linux version available.
The goal for this patch is to get OMX statemachine working without any faults during Engine Open/close and Process/Control calls.
|please ignore this comment, realized it is in board file for 4430sdp.
|whya re we naming it as 4430sdp?? this works on 4460 and 4470 as well, right? 44xx would be more appropriate.
|I dont think we follow omap. for properties.
your suggestion is valid to avoid conflicts with android framework level properties.

|will change the tabs to spaces.
|Buftype carries the handle type, whether it is a virtual pointer, gralloc handle, or ion handle. Here, the conversion is done from:
source: gralloc pointer for buffer of RGB
dest: gralloc pointer for buffer of NV-12
|we can avoid this call if the crop is already at the requested value, by checking the requested param vs the src/dest queue params.
|(1) Codec returns outputID in sequential array starting from &quot;0&quot; index. Once we hit NULL outputID, that is the end of the valid data from Codec.

(2) Im initializing the variable &quot;i&quot; to &quot;0&quot; at line # 311
So i parse the entire freeID array and process all the buffers that codec freed in that process call.
|The original idea when we added flags to memplugin_alloc was to carry any flag (eg cacheable, and caching types etc). 

Lets leave it as flags to be generic and inline with memplugin_alloc().

|The issue popped out only because we have 3 pipes instead of 4.  It used to work earlier because we had 4 pipes, and all math results in &quot;ints&quot;. but now with max of 3 dss pipes.

#ifdef EARLYCAMERA_IPU

|i think we should init them to '1'.
|dont comment this line. it was just a WA on your setup
|remove extra space
|lets define something like max number of gpios and parse only till that number. so that we dont parse unwanted gpios on J6EVM and fail the driver.
|we still have tiler and dmm drivers. Dont we need this chmod?
|Are we sure we dont need tiler driver access here?
is ION driver hiding everything inside?
|we cleaned-up the DOMX the dependency.
and there is no omap4xxx/domx folder.
|We should change the max simultaneous cameras as well.
|one suggestion: Instead of adding these checks everywhere inside libdce, it will be good if you could abstract it inside the libdce client (some TI HAL component for GLSDK) and then use memHeader's offset field to pass the UV buffer offset. This is what i Implemented in Android and im reusing this offset for even decoder input buffer offsets. I remember you telling that there is no TI MMHAL for GLSDK, if it is still the case, we have to live with these checks here anyway.
|I dont see license headers for any make files.
|since it is inside dra7xx folder, do we still need to check for variants?? today we have only J6 and J6eco, and this is applicable for both.
|Earlier we used to keep all the changes under OMAP_ENHANCEMENT check, is it no longer required????
|Do we need these changes???
|why is this zlib required??
|These changes are legacy from omap4. we dont need them here.
|This logic should go into else part of sw vsync. otherwise we end of having this thread created even for SW Vsync scenarios.
|Does it work for QNX???
|Where are we disabling the planes unused in this composition but were previously enabled.
|Why are we excluding &quot;0&quot;th layer?
|Do we really need this dss_plane_limit variable?
I think we can achieve the same with the variable &quot;avail_ovls&quot;
|do you want to keep these logs to enable in future for debugging purpose??
|This limitation should be removed once we have DSS acceleration patches merged.
|I guess you are checking it inside bdev-&gt;prepare(), right.
Still you may have to check for layer not being NULL before accessing its composition type here.
|there is a possibility of getting some NULL layers, or layers with SKIP flag. We should check for them.
|I think we should check for layer for not NULL before accessing its compostionType. I remember having a scenario where some of the  layers could be NULL.
|my previous comment for removing dead code for logs is applicable everywhere.
|Change this hardcoding. Use the below formula:
width = ALIGN(width, HW_ALIGN)

include hal_public.h to get the ALIGN macro and HW_ALIGN definitions.
|Why do we need two buffers? is it for Y and UV planes??
we can allocate only one buffer and pass offset for the second plane.
|I thought of adding the suggestion of duplicating the pointer on Y and UV desc as part of my first review comment, but refrained thinking that codec might be checking for pointer on Y and UV planes not being the same!
If they require two different pointers, we can still provide them with two pointers on single memplugin allocated buffers.
|Do we want to close the rpmsg-dce device when the buffers are destroyed? and re-create during the next first buffer creation??
it may result into multiple times open and close for rpmsg-dce device. Lets run our robustness tests with this patch before merging.
|This count will be finalized after testing with the optimized TILER-1D patches
|OSAL_ErrorTrace is not functional, hence thought of changing the error traces to ALOGE.
|Will address it.
|How about the above DeleteTask call. The same deadlock can happen here as well, right?
Probably we need to move the mutex acquire further down!!

Also, we may need to check which of these call need to be protected from being re-entrant, so that we can place mutex acquire accordingly.

why do we have to enable secondary display right from boot? we may have enable it dynamically based on some key press or surface flinger commands.
|Patch Set 1: No score

correcting the Verified field, which i entered wrongly in the last review.
|Patch Set 1:

yes i understand.
but the point what i would like to emphasize here is:
(1) as per the power management guidelines, we should not enable the HW unless it is requested for use. and we should disable it once done. 
  but here in this logic, the display1 is always enabled.
(2) going forward, the managers and the overlay devices are not statically mapped, hence we need to have a logic to query and then set the device to appropriate manager.

  so i prefer we should have this piece of code in our surface flinger or somewhere else, instead of init.rc.
|Patch Set 1:

Cemil,
for enabling the dev video device at run time, i'm using the
file open/read/write operations from overlay library.
we can check if we can do the same thing from Surface Flinger
DisplayHW device or wherever it is appropriate.

That's the direction. To have a settings option to change the display ID. But i'm still understanding on how to do that.

|Patch Set 2:

Hi Keith,

The screen ID is exercised at the Overlay level to configure the requested Panel.
And it is null for OMAP3 at this point.
Hence the video always comes on primary LCD.
Once TV support is added for OMAP3 at overlay level, we can test it using the same app.
|Patch Set 2:

For OMAP3 at this point, yes, you are correct.
Whatever option you select it goes to only the primary LCD, without any errors.

Going forward:
(1) OMAP3 support for TV
(2) Intelligence in app data base for different platforms (may be different xmls). this is something we need to explore.

Deva,
i suggest using the setParameter API to set the required number of overlay buffers, than hardcoding it.

so that we can change the number as per resolution or codec and any other needs.
|Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Acceptable for this release.
Once OMX port negotiation for number of buffers is supported,
the overlay number of buffers can be changed based on the
video resolution.

Hi Grigory,

there are 2 concerns:
(1) Why did you add setParameter to the control context interface. this is accessible only by the surface flinger.
I assume that, this setparameter is expected to be called by the client once it detects 3D content, right? Please correct me if im wrong.

(2) The current overlay library is common between OMAP3 and OMAP4. Since S3D is applicable only for OMAP4, please guard all S3D calls under TARGET_OMAP4 macro.

|Patch Set 1:

Hi Hari,

If i understand O_NONBLOCK functionality correctly, none of the functions with this file descriptor cause the calling process to Wait. Hence, there is no looping at all with this patch. (there was always looping in the earlier logic).

But the actual concern would be in the normal working scenario where: previously the DQUE call guaranteed to return the free buffer, and this assumption is no longer valid in the subsequent logic. For this we can look at Lajo's suggestion of implementing timer.
|Patch Set 1:

Muthu,

Hi Kalpesh,

There is no specific reason on why it can't be added in device open. But my idea is to defer the data structure population till the overlay data object is successfully created.
If your next question is: then why is it added in device open for control object !!!
then my answer is device open for control object is one time, where as overlay create is for every overlay object we create.
|Patch Set 1:

Kalpesh,

My understanding is that, the global variables are made static to make them file scoped and also to push them to the data segment. Can you be more specific if there are any concerns on making them static.

Hi Chris &amp; Tyler,

Yeah, I agree that it is good to have a multiple patches each with logical development than a single one.
But having multiple will create lot of dependencies among them, like once i remove the previous one, unless i add next two patches, the functionality will be temporarily broken on DB. and even tracking is also painful. Thats why submitted single patch.

|Patch Set 1:

Muthu,

You are absolutely right.
The issue is not with KEY_S3D_SUPPORTED.
The fault is due to &quot; KEY_S3D2D_PREVIEW&quot;

the actual fix is to check for non-NULL for this param.
and the same logic is added for KEY_S3D_SUPPORTED as it could be next potential issue on customer platforms where the xml is entirely different from TIs.
|Patch Set 1:

That is one of the options.
But the argument there would be: if we start adding all the parameters to all the sensors, then every new camera property xml file has to carry all the irrelevant values.
Hence given fix in a common place.

|Patch Set 1:

Hi Keith,

Yes, HDMI kernel driver is sending some spurious events during cable attach (due to debouncing may be).
I'm cheking with kernel team for this. But in any case,
I feel it is good to have some kind of stablizing timer even on user side. Thats why submitted this patch.
|Patch Set 1: (1 inline comment)

Kalpesh,
The new debounce timer doesn't add any delay for the actual events, because we start timer and go ahead with servicing the event.
The delay comes into picture for the subsequent spurious events with will happen within 1sec. I chose 1 sec because no human activated events can happen within 1 sec, right.
|Patch Set 1:

Kalpesh,

In the sequence of spurious events, the first one should always be the correct one, otherwise, if it is the same as the current state, there wouldn't be any event, right?

Eg: we are at State0

Trigger: Cable attached
state1
state0 
state1
.
.
.
is the only sequence possible. It cant be 
state0
state1
state0
.
.
because, in the second scenario,there would not any event for state0-&gt; state0

|Patch Set 1:

Hi Keith,

It is the hdmi observer from VideoView which is getting destroyed.
My understanding is that, earlier we are calling new for every videoview construction, but it is not freed explicitly (might be getting freed in the background by garbage collector).
But now with this patch we are freeing it up more explicitly.
|Patch Set 1:

Hi Keith,

What do you mean by initial HDMI state??
is it the state when we instantiate Video view??
if so, as soon as Video View registers with hdmi observer, the current state (which is the initial state wrt to Videoview) is notified to it.
|Patch Set 1:

Kalpesh,

Hi Keith,

In order to enhance usecases and support some optimizations for playback, there is a need to pass few parameters during overlay creation itself. We can't use setParameter as the decision needs to be taken during overlay creation itself.
eg: to set the overlay number of buffers, to set Video modes like low power or clone and if any in future.

Which is purely because of timings and in the past we couldn't solve this issue. Now we need to provide some fix for sure. And the fix would be in overlay, hence there is one more patch required.

Thanks Anu. I have added OMAP4 checks.
|Patch Set 2:

Hi Keith,

zorder is a DSS HW feature by which we can control the ordering of the video &amp; graphics pipelines on the DSS overlay managers.
eg: we can specify whether GFX pipeline is on top or bottom of video pipeline through this zorder value. Here z refers to the (z axis in 3D plane).
The corresponding kernel patch is
http://review.omapzoom.org/#change,10675
|Patch Set 2:

This is a new feature in OMAP4, and not supported on OMAP3.
|Patch Set 2:

Hi Keith,

For Froyo, L25x is still on 2.6.32 kernel i believe.
Hence the branches are entirely different.
When we move to GB where OMAP3 will also be on 2.6.35 we needn't have omap4 check in bionic.
|Patch Set 2:

Hi Keith,

Sorry i didn't get your comment.
My idea is to not to break any other version of V4L2. Hence i added omap4 check in bionic. This new parameter will come into picture only for OMAP4 platform, in which case our kernel patch handles this new parameter.
|Patch Set 2:

Hi Hari/Keith,

I agree with your point that it can be ignored for omap3 if it not configurable in the hardware.
The problem comes wrt to header while compiling the dependent libraries. If i add it in bionic without processor checks,
I need to add this parameter even in 2.6.32 kernel code base
If you have any suggestions on handling this in a better way, i'm ready to incorporate them.
|Patch Set 2:

Hi Keith,

Please let me know if i answered your comments.
This patch has to be merged soon as the kernel patch has already gone in.
|Patch Set 2:

Hi Keith,

This is one of the options i proposed above.
but i have implemented the second option of having processor check so that i neednt touch omap3 code base.

Before proceeding with UI rotation patches, we need to first fix the change permission concern that Keith has raised for overlays and fbs.
We have to associate ourselves to some group and owner and give permissions only to that group and the service which is using these sysfs should be also in the same group.

|Patch Set 1:

Hi Kalpesh,

This is not a issue with Z-order or Color key.
Because we enabled per-pixel alpha ideally if the framebuffer was 1080p, surface flinger would have allocated proper window and the alpha blend would have been enabled properly in the UI buffer.But currently we are upscaling the WVGA, this issue comes.
But we can workaround by z-order or colorkey.

Hi Saket,

Mirroring is enabled intentionally for secondary camera.
But this patch is clashing with overlay rotation patch and hence mirror is halfway done, this is because the rotation is disabled for HDMI. I will fix the liboverlay patch and then we can submit both together.
|Patch Set 2:

Because the secondary camera is a front facing camera.
Whatever it captures would be mirror image of ours.
In order get proper preview we need to do horizontal mirroring.
Where as for primary camera, which is back facing one, captures normal image.
|Patch Set 2:

Hi Kalpesh,

I have already answered this. Here is the summary of my answers:
(1) Mirroring is broken on HDMI because of liboverlay rotation fix. this is why you are seeing vertically flipped image on HDMI. This one i have fixed in liboverlay patch.

(2) without mirroring for front facing camera, if you observe preview carefully, you will see the below issue:
  If you raise your right hand infront of camera, you will see as if left hand is raised. you can do that experiment to understand this feature.

And Android has enabled this mirroring from Camera service in GB. it is not what we are doing from APP.
Our responsibility is to service the flip call from surface flinger. This is what i had provided sometime back.

Kalpesh,

till now we are using only video source transparency for enabling color key. Now for the first time we are going to enable gfx-destination,:

|Patch Set 1:

I see another issue with Vid1 zorder being 0:

currently in overlay we limit the vid pipe zorder being 0 or 1.
So, if the app sets zorder to 0, the behavior would become unpredictable in H/W.
If i hardcode the zorder, there is no more control from app!
|Patch Set 1:

The issue is because of two video pipes having the same zorder.

H/W behvior is unpredictable in that scenario. that is the probelm.
|Patch Set 1:

So in my overlay patch: 
I'm changing the zorder only for TV case.
This is with the assumption that we support UI cloning only on TV. hope this is a valid assumption.

Saket,

This is a port from Froyo.
It was missed our during syncup activity.

Here is the corresponding Froyo patch.
http://review.omapzoom.org/#change,6505
|Patch Set 1:

We will need this logic to eliminate the multiple seek events coming from Media Player with in few milli secs.
This results in seeking to the same IFrame and hence results in repeating Video and Audio.
But the threshold needs to be identified and also the location for this buffering logic, If media player is not acceptable, it should be done in application at least.
|Patch Set 1:

Karim has ported the Music player logic to Media controller to handle the multiple seek events. We will verify Yong's patch and that one, and we can decide which is more robust,
We can reuse this patch for music player port to have history.
|Uploaded patch set 2.
|Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

This one is fixing the jitter during AV clip seek.
This is the same logic as used in Android Music Player app to avoid bounce during Audio seek.
|Patch Set 2:

Hi Saket,

I fully agree with your comment.
In fact yesterday myself and Ajay were thinking the same thing. But we cant find out the next Iframe duration at Media Controller level and one more thing is if the repetion of video if of the order of seconds (because of I frames are seconds apart) we dont see jitter instead it will be clear from video that it got adjusted to the nearest I frame. But for small durations like msec repetition is manifesting like a jitter.
|Patch Set 2:

Saket,

It seems the 250msec used for music player is not related to Audio buffer, instead it is like user capability to issue two seeks within 250 msec. In any human interaction events, two event can not be triggered within 250msec, with that confidence, i believe the debouncing time is arrived at for music player.

|Patch Set 1:

Did you test AV playback suspend/resume by pressing home button.
I had an issue on OMAP4 for that, since last frame is valid we are going to softwareRenderer hence it fails on resume.
Inside ::resume() {
 if (state-&gt;mLastVideoFrame &amp;&amp; mISurface != NULL) {
        mVideoRenderer =
            new AwesomeLocalRenderer(
                    true,  // previewOnly

I think the default timings of the driver are not zero.
It is VGA, which means that till HDMI is first attached we are anyway maintaining non ZERO value.
And here the issue is not in delaying the event to user.
As mentioned in the description, after delay of 100msec, once the event is communicated to user, the timings are reset to zero because of detach event.

The logic to handle 1/4 and 8 scaling factors are already taken care in the earlier patches.
Now this patch is to avoid any scaling (not even 1/2) while rendering at 1080p timings.

The description of the patch says there are errors because DISPC is accessing stale registers on resume.

This is not Correct, DISPC is already taking care of disabling all the VID pipes on suspend, hence on resume DISPC doesn't access any buffers unless they are explicitly enabled by user side after providing the valid buffer pointers,

And the change in the patch is incorrect as we are enabling the pipe without making sure that there are valid buffers queued before enabling it.

Hi Saket/Artem,

My answers are inline.
And i didn't get why do you say it is a hack.
It is the kernel recommended synchronization method to guarantee that no IRQ handlers are executed after this call on any CPU. That is what we exactly want here.

Please let me know your options.

Since the implementation is OMAP_ENHANCEMENT specific, can't we just add an custom ConfigIndex and use the setConfig/getConfig interface??

Anyway the string you are checking for is OMAP specific hence it is not generic.

Am I missing any other aspect of this approach?

If possible could you test it and let me know your observations.
|Patch Set 1:

Hi Artem,

I have tested both the scenarios, and didn't observe any issue.
(1) Wifi signal strength: The patch doesn't come into picture when there is no video, hence this scenario is uneffected

(2) Youtube app: We support only full screen mode on TV when Video is present, no more cloning.
Hence there is no concept of entering and exiting full screen mode on HDMI. 
HDMI is always showing the full screen and LCD is entering and exiting full screen properly.
|Patch Set 1:

Hi Jean,

I have verified both the scenarios he mentioned,and didn't see any issue.

Hi Rajesh,

The logic in patchset3 is applicable even for 720p clips.
Only addition from patch set1 is to check for scaling limits, and if it is &gt; 2x, then only ignore force_sgx, else we can stick to the original behavior, instead of ignoring force_sgx for all Video scaling limits.

Regards,
Sunita.

Hi Rajesh,

Sorry, i didn't understand the change made in patchset 4.
you have changed the scale limit boundary check, earlier it was 1-2048, you made it 0-2048. But your comment says as if the scale limit value is changed to ZERO. Am i missing anything???

|Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

same comment as earlier patch. I would be good and easy to maintain if this is maintained as a separate lib or atleast separate files.

If you are going to push this to Google, then i'm fine and no need to put it in a separate file.

Hi Tony,

If we merge WB fifo to GFX, it may result into Overflows for WB. But anyway we are not targeting the WB fifo merge in the final builds. It was done in large displays only as a temporary WA.

Does this logic work with separate Y and UV pointers?
|Patch Set 2:

Hi Illia,

Then we can't break the functionality with separate Y and UV pointers. Can we make the new change under macro for SGX544 or some particular DDK version, preferably with runtime checks.
|Patch Set 2:

Hi Illia,

Any update on this patch. If there is no simple way to maintain backward compatibility, its ok, let us get this patch into mainline so that it can be used on the latest codebase at least.

The FrameDecoder should be invoked from CameraHAL instead of V4L2 CameraAdapter.
We can consider Framedecoder as one of the nodes in the algorithm framework.

|Patch Set 1:

This patch needn't be blocked for dual display support.
We can enable HDMI in legacy cloning mode, for that we need just the second FB support, for which patches are under review. and without this we need to carry HACK patches to enable HDMI on mainline.

It was decided to have only 720p as the mirror region. If this is breaking the HDMI default display functionality we should fix it in hwc.c but can't change the property to 1280:800 which would result in improper scaling ratio.
|Patch Set 1:

Have you tested Video playback in mirroring mode with this change?
and also what about UI status on 1080p resolution TV? is it now 1728x1080 with black boxes on either side?
|Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Showing UI with black bars will not give good user experience. but since there is no status bar, i'm going ahead with this patch merge.

hi Gowtham,

Instead of making each fine into single patch, lets put all framesworks/native changes into one patch saying &quot;Surface flinger changes for multiple display&quot;/

This way it  is easy to review and track and also gives the complete picture in one patch. single file patches are too confusing and looks incomplete.

Thanks,
Sunita.

yes we have to first merge to p-linux branch.
and regarding #if 0 inside the dump function,  i think its better to comment only in the caller, and keeping the function active, so that the function can still be used by others if any (any sysFS entry to dump it !!!!)

Hi Saurabh,

(1) Your assumption for single client &lt;-&gt; single process is not valid in Android. I think it wouldn't be valid even in Linux/QNX once they verify at complete UI level. Today you see multiprocess behavior because of test case.

(2) If there are no two clients in the single process, then there is no value add by the semaphore logic earlier. since it was created new for every client. 

(3) The reason i moved the count check outside the dce_ipc_init is to reuse the single count check between sem and ipc handle creates.

Hi Pradeep,

In which usecase are you facing this issue?
I have seen the same packet corruption issue during simultaneous encode and decode, where in, the process and control calls are preempted or executed in parallel. And i have pushed a similar patch but only to protect control and process calls.
http://review.omapzoom.org/#/c/34475/

And would like to get confirmation from IPC team that the packet corruption is indeed an expected behavior if multiple clients issue requests simultaneously.

Can we move the lock to just around MmRpc_call()?

Hi Buddy,

I prefer to leave the basic call description like: create, control and process. Especially process call is important because the bufdesc details are useful as they are different on different OSes.

This patch breaks LI (OV10633) sensor.
The VIN2_S2 and VIN2_S0 GPIOs are common b/w LI and TVP sensor controls and hence need to be set in their probes.

Hi Venkat,

Since i dont want to change the mutex behavior for other OSes (Linux and QNX), I set the attributes after it is initialized. 
If every OS supports this and is required, then we can move it to the init phase.

Hi Marcus,

We need to check why HDMI is detected and published as the first display when no HDTV is connected.

There is no assumption from Android UI or HWC for display ordering. It relies on Kernel for deciding the display order, and whatever is decided as the the first display (display0) that is what is configured and controlled from HWC init_primary display.
|Patch Set 1:

Hi Marcus,

Still i didnt get how is HDMI published as the valid display when it is not even detected. does driver register it during the probe irrespective of HPD and hence it is always present. and we didnt see the issue earlier bcoz it was not the first one in the list??

And what made it happening now?? i suspect some spurious event latched onto HDMI I2C lines due to I/O programming in u-boot.

Hi Buddy,

Yes, your observation is correct. Android uses memplugin even before DCE is initialized and hence the mutex attributes need to be set in memplugin init.

Please add the reference counting changes here itself. or provide your comments so that i can handle.

Hi Karthik,


Either add the refer counting changes as a separate patch. or
add another patchset for my original patch. Im not going to abandon my patch.

But Karthik, this mutex init can't be removed from libdce main file, as it is used by QNX.
When i initially put Android patch, i wanted to make the exact same change, but becoz of QNX/linux i had to set the attributes later, which is allowed in android bionic.
If it is not allowed in Linux, we should use #ifndef GLSDK
but we cant remove it.
Lets make delta changes as a separate (in this patch) patch with description for the exact issue, for better clarity.

|Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2
|Has this been validated on 3430, 3440 and 3630?
|This function returns 1 if the OMAP is not supported.
Should it not return 1 if it cannot find the QOS dll?

The logic should be the same for the 2 cases. it seems inverted right now.

or may be i dont understand the purpose correctly.
|Please sort the list in ascending order of resolution.. if it is not too much work.
|Change default to 30 please.
|where is the requirement for RAW AMR coming from?
|Please set the default to 30.
|Please do not remove the support(for AudioBitrate, AudioChannels, Sampling Rate) that is already present. When you spoke about AudioBitrate, I assumed that you were adding support for it and therefore said not to bother with it. Sorry.
|Why are we adding support for RAW_AMR? Was it present it Donut? Did anybody request it?
|Would it be too much work to rearrange them in ascending order of size? When we open the menu, we have to traverse up and down searching for the resolution we want.
|You mentioned an issue with setting resolution as a result of this aspect ratio calculation. is that resolved?
|Please do not delete unused stuff..
Make minimal changes to support what we need.
|this change looks suspicious to me. Jorge, please take a look at it.
|Is it possible that pDynParams could be NULL at this point? i didnt check the whole function.. Do we need to check that it is not NULL before trying to free it.
|looks like a typo.. needs to be corrected.
|Please do not spin here forever waiting for the aTimestamp to become 0. May be that is why you are seeing ANR messages. Put in some timeout mechanism with proper debug messages.
|Sunita,

The library will be named overlay.zoom2 for 3630 and 3430 and overlay.omap4 for omap4?

Anu
|Where is this defined? are we not using it anymore?
|Already declared above..
|Please convert your tabs to 4 spaces. Basically, get rid of all the red stuff...
|Please remove this print.
|Is there a reason you are repeating the enums 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4?
|Please replace tabs with spaces
|Please add some timeout mechanism.
|Manuel,

What is this for?
|it seems like you are ORing 1 to ulPPType because you dont want to touch other bits. But you have set ulPPType to 0 in the previous line. Is there a problem here? same comment applies to all the other changes...
|this appears to be wrong file to put these definitions...
|Sunita,

I dont know how things are in omap4. But tell me if this will be acceptable to you:

in overlay_common.h we specify

#ifdef OMAP3
#define MAX_OVERLAY_WIDTH_VAL 1280
#define MAX_OVERLAY_HEIGHT_VAL 1280
#define MAX_OVERLAY_RESOLUTION (1280*720)
#elsif OMAP4
#define MAX_OVERLAY_WIDTH_VAL 1280
#define MAX_OVERLAY_HEIGHT_VAL 1280
#define MAX_OVERLAY_RESOLUTION specify_your_limits
#endif

may be we can change the mcaro MAX_OVERLAY_RESOLUTION to have a more meaningful name..
|Please replace tabs with spaces.
What will happen if you return QOS_DENY?
Can the error message printed be more meaningful?
Does this alter the timing in such a way that the issue is masked?
|do we really need a switch stmt here?
can we store V4L2_OVERLAY_PLANE_VIDEOX in an array and just index into it...
|again, dont see the need for 'if... else...&quot; here. use array indexing..
|It should be 

if (w &lt;= MIN_OVERLAY_WIDTH_VAL &#124;&#124; h &lt;= MIN_OVERLAY_WIDTH_VAL)

we are still discussing what that min value should be for omap3.
you should find out what it is for omap4. it should be based on max scaling factor as well since surface flinger tries to scale to full screen most of the time.

Its ok to merge as is - for now.
|The crop window is initialized to overlay width and height. So, why do you see this problem?
|This is redundant since it is already initialized in createOverlay.
|Manuel,
The ultimate result of this patch is same as removing that 'if' condition.
Anu
|disable_streaming should probably be removed.. I am checking with Axel.
|Can we leave this in there as extra protection???
|if there is no memcpy, then pBuffer pointer should not change. right? that is the bug you should look into.

can you add a check to see if this happens during runtime - that is - check all the buffer pointers in EmptyThisBuffer() to ensure that they were allocated by overlay.
|Have you had a chance to investigate how this flag is getting used? Why was opencore passing non-overlay buffers?
I vaguely remember that setting this flag to FALSE will introduce a memcpy.
This change needs more investigation.
|I need more information. I dont understand the issue or the solution.

Moreover, cropping is supposed to work on the fly. We should not disable stream to set cropping. Also, window should be unchanged.
|Wrong place for adding MAX_Resolution. Please move it else where.
|Where is this parameter maxInputSize set?
|Please move this macro under 'ifdef TARGET_OMAP4'.
Define it like this for omap3:
#define NUM_OVERLAY_BUFFERS_MAX NUM_OVERLAY_BUFFERS_REQUESTED
|this will fail for omap3. in TIOverlay, it will be reset to the max no. of buffers which is 6.
|yes. i added it. it is there in the current code base. i added some test cases to test call sequences.

    //Call Sequence: resizeInput cannot be called after queueBuffer()
    ret = mOverlay1-&gt;resizeInput(200, 200);
    RET_CHECK_NOTEQ(ret, 0, __LINE__);
|this error scenario is tested in the overlay test app. if you are removing this logic, then you need to remove that test case from the test app as well.
|Please use this API for that purpose : overlay_data_setParameter()
|Why are we doing this?
|why not increase this to 100000? Are you seeing no improvements when this value is &gt; 50000?
|This is only a comment i think.
|is this correct?
|is this correct?
|ok. will change that.
|ok. will change that.
|how about the max channels? is it not 2?
|should you add another check to ensure that you are not exceeding the max no.of buffers supported by overlay?
|Can we remove all the commented out lines?
|then why do we check for &quot;OMX.TI.Video.Decoder&quot; and &quot;OMX.TI.720P.Decoder&quot; in the omap4 condition? it does no harm.. but i am curious why?
|this condition can be merged with the previous 'if' condition. this condition will never be entered for omap3 since the previous condition will be satisfied.
|I dont see who is setting the flags parameter. Why do you need it?
|I was just trying to avoid this scenario..
In future the number 20 changes to say 22 and you have to hunt all the places where 20 was used...
|Should you be using a macro from overlay_common.h?
|Done
|Just wondering...

Should this be handled inside your OMX components? I dont recall you making such changes in opencore..
|why is this line required?
|Is OMX_ERROR4 the right one to use? will it show up in the logs by default?
|Done
|Done
|Just a suggestion.. no of lines of code can be reduced like this...

switch(...)
case wmv:
minWidth = VIDDEC_MIN_WMV_WIDTH;
minHeight = VIDDEC_MIN_WMV_WIDTH
case mpeg4:
minWidth = VIDDEC_MIN_MPEG4_WIDTH;
minHeight = VIDDEC_MIN_MPEG4_WIDTH
..
}

if((nWidth &lt; minwidth) &#124;&#124; (nHeight &lt; minheight)){
OMX_ERROR4(pComponentPrivate-&gt;dbg, &quot;Unsuported resolution, nWidth = %d; nHeight = %d
&quot;, nWidth, nHeight);
             return OMX_ErrorUnsupportedSetting;
}
|are we sure that we removed all such redundant code now?
|Done
|are you sure this is the right thing to do? OMX_ALL is defined like this:

#define OMX_ALL 0xFFFFFFFF
|Please delete all the qualcomm codecs... we will never test with those..
|Remove the print statement since you are not postponing Stream Enable. It can be misleading. In fact, comment out the above condition and instead add this:

if (!overlayobj-&gt;dataReady) {
    LOGI(&quot;Cannot enable stream without queuing at least one buffer&quot;);
    return -1
}
|what is the intent here? Should you be using this:

printDelay++ / 1000000ll
|what is the intent here? Should you be using this:

printDelay++ / 1000000ll
|i had to comment these lines bcos they print too many messages
|is this if condition necessary every time we go through the loop? can it not be calculated once before the do-loop?
|so, it doesnt hang anymore? what fixed it? should i validate on omap3 as well?
|Please enable this for omap3. we are using it.
|Please enable for omap3. we are using it.
|did you just move this section or change some logic here?
why was it moved?
|Done
|Can mutex unlock be removed now???
|i dont see a problem with it. i just think it is redundant now.
|No need to be omap4 specific.
|i dont see why this has to be omap4 specific...
|why cant we just modify the existing one? why create a new one?
|Not that i know of. 
KW pointed it out.
Plus it was a code review comment from one of our customers.
|ok. i changed my mind. You are overwriting the values read from media_profiles.xml. 
Consider adding your own media_profiles.xml.
|We can probably remove this ifdef. Within TIOverlay, we can ignore this setting for omap3 or we can send the correct value from upper layers...
|OMX_VIDEO_CodingVP6 is not equal to OMX_VIDEO_CodingMJPEG+1. 
Same for OMX_VIDEO_CodingVP7

Both are defined by TI so their int value is really large.
|this had to be made public bcos it is called from the derived class on the TIOMXCodec object from within a static function.
|Do you intend to pass 0 instead of isinterlaced(trackMeta) ?
|Is there a need to make this OMAP4 specific? wont isInterlaced() return 0 ?
|Does this build fine? NPA_BUFFERS is defined in OMXCodec.cpp ...
|Should this change be made omap4 specific even though it is not acted upon in TIOverlay.cpp for OMAP3... Some OMAP3 customers use per pixel alpha blending..
|can we remove this whole section( for setting color key) now?
|Please remove this log stmt. or make it LOGV.
|Are you sure you want to enable this all the time?
Didnt we make it conditional previously?
|is there a reason for make this omap4 specific?
|Earlier, you were setting the zorder for overlay0 and overlay1. But it is set for only one overlay. Is that intentional?
|This value is updated once again, later on, when the overlay buffers are received.
|Shouldn't we adjust posW accordingly - to maintain the aspect ratio?
|same as above. posH should also be modified?
|i dont see any omap3/omap4 flags. Wasnt the window calculation diff for omap3 vs omap4?
|i tried it earlier and ducati recovery was not working at all. i had to reboot the blaze.

i will implement for thumbnail mode too.
|agreed. changing my vote
|Please add a condition to do this only for HDMI.
I am worried that if we come across applications where the window moves around a lot, this might cause some artifacts.
|variables mSurfaceCtrl3 and mSurfaceCtrl4 are local to this function.
|i guess we are trying to be extra cautious. :)
This is what we do today in TIHardwareRenderer and so i prefer to keep it the same.
|This is not related to the memory leak.
it looks like it controls zorder of the surface associated with overlay.
Since, i am also using this module for just allocating the buffers but not for displaying them, i want the option to hide this layer/push it down.
|Yes. this is a TI file but some people compile it without the omap_enahncement flag. in which case, you will see a compiler error bcos here we are changing an Android interface.
|omap_enhancement flag is missing.
|I have also increased the timeout just to be on the safe side.
|Flash uses AACDecoder and it does not appear to be handled by OMXCodec. All calls go through ThreadedSource. So, we are fine here.
|the offset is not considered... so the resulting image would have a black band at the top and left?
|the frame is dumped at root??
better to dump in sdcard or data folder.
|Is there a need to explicitly call mDealer.clear() ? Won't it get freed automatically when the destructor is called?
|Can we move this code to ~OMXCodec or ~OMXNodeInstance?

Even otherwise, is it not the component's responsibility to clean up?
|Jorge,
In ICS, they included the state LOADED_TO_IDLE in the above check. May be you could do the same.

    CHECK(mState == LOADED &#124;&#124; mState == ERROR &#124;&#124; mState == LOADED_TO_IDLE);

and so, you can remove the setState from here.
|indentation needed
|indentation incorrect
|it seems like this library will be opened everytime we do gallery playback. i prefer that we check the component name beforehand and open it only if needed.
|it seems like the above stmt is common for netflix as well as gallery playback. so, it can be put outside the if function - meaning no need to duplicate this line.
|i dont get this. why are we closing the library immediately?
|I prefer that the existing function interface is updated instead of adding a new function. Maintenance will be easier.
|Please correct white space errors.

It is misleading to put this logic after the above comment. Please move it before the comment.
|Dont return NULL. it will be interpreted as OK.
|Sundar, I considered your proposal. But it is clashing with the slice mode implementation. We cannot have camera going to idle first. Tunnel must be setup first, and then encoder goes to idle and then only camera can move to idle.
|This change will trigger the query for [max_camera - starting_camera] times. That is not what we want.. We want to query only once – only for that particular camera id.
In other words, we want the while loop in CameraAdapter_Capabilities() to execute only once. 

So, please try this out:

Int discard_this_parameter;
CameraAdapter_Capabilities(properties, X, X+1, &amp;discard_this_parameter)

Do not use num_cameras for the last parameter. It will be overwritten with incorrect value. It may create a bug in future.

|Some applications dont check the number of cameras first.
For example, the current android camera app does not perform this check.
|Response for getNumberOfCameras()
---------------------
if that is so, then i need to add the above logic to getNumberOfCameras() as well. 2 things can happen

1. The app queries while VTC is in progress. In which case, even if i query the camera module once again, it will still return 0 and therefore the app will not call connect.

2. The app queries after VTC has been stopped. In which case, we query the camera module and it returns the right number of cameras and the app continues and calls connect.

int32_t CameraService::getNumberOfCameras() {
    if (mNumberOfCameras == 0) mNumberOfCameras = mModule-&gt;get_number_of_cameras();
    return mNumberOfCameras;
}

---------------------
Response for getCameraInfo()
---------------------
The query is rerouted to CameraHal_Module which will take care to read again from ducati if the information was not previously populated. So no chnages needed here.

--------------

Do you agree?

FYI: Today, this is not happenning...i mean the app is not querying before calling connect.
|I dont understand your question. this is where the client is trying to connect... and in case the mNumberOfCameras is not populated correctly, then the client's request will be rejected. Therefore, I am updating the value here..
|It is not checked for the same reason that it is not checked in CameraService::Client::startPreviewMode(). I wanted to keep the behavior same..
|Shouldnt this be 1?
|it is not dynamically configurable. Therefore, moving it under 'if(!previewEnabled()) '.
|yes. 
also, it is not dynamically configurable. Therefore, moving it under 'if(!previewEnabled()) '.
|I cannot move the below code. This will stay here.
Because, for setting up the tunnel, we need to know the preview width and height which is read much later than the static parameters above.
|removed all redundant occurences.
earlier, i meant to infer it, then decided that it is better to set it explicitly. Hence you see this variable being set in various places.
|ok. :)
|done
|Once startPreview is called, there is no need to continue to remember whether the function cameraPreviewInitialization() was called earlier or not. And so the flag mPreviewInitializationDone is reset here. Plus, this preserves the current behavior of startPreview under the circumstances where the application calls startPreview twice or more.
|stopPreview() will be called explicitly by the application.
Remember that we want the stopPreview to happen in 2 steps. When CAMERA_CMD_PREVIEW_DEINITIALIZATION is called, the component moves to idle state and when stopPreview is called, the component moves to loaded state.
|agreed.
|agreed
|not sure i completely understand.. will do my best.
|Yes. That's correct. I had added 3 commands initially:
    1. set up tunnel
    2. camera preview init
    3. destroy tunnel

---------------------------

And after a few email exchanges with sundar, it was decided to change it this way:

     1. set up tunnel - make it a setParameter

     2. camera preview init - stayed as is
     3. destroy tunnel - renamed as camera preview deinit since setup tunnel was removed.
|Well...  that was the original implementation. But since you asked me to remove changes to framework, i had to resort to this..
|ok
|i could.. But it is not necessary since the same instance of CameraHal is not going to be used for non VTC purposes. But for future proofing, i will reset it here.
|Everywhere - meaning in decoder and encoder - OMX_COLOR_FormatYUV420PackedSemiPlanar is the format we use... i found it odd that camera uses OMX_COLOR_FormatYUV420SemiPlanar...

Anyway, for both formats, the result is the same.. i didnt find difference in camera output.

For uniformity's sake, i set it to OMX_COLOR_FormatYUV420PackedSemiPlanar
|Disabling the preview port and freeing the buffers caused ducati to go into a bad state.This issue is observed only during slice mode. Therefore, preview port disable/enable has been removed and the preview buffers are now freed when moving from idle to loaded state. 

This issue is known to ducati folks and they recommended this approach. 

Since we are freeing the buffers when moving from idle to loaded state, port disable is not needed anymore. Since there is no port disable, port enable is not required either.

Please revisit the change you made in aac dec utils file.

- As a general rule, please do not add too many ifdefs in the code - avoid them as much as possible. For example, for the DEBUG logs, there are many cleaner ways of doing it.

Please test with this patch to see if the issue reported in the DR OMAPS00209213 is not seen anymore. The OMX VE is returning all the buffers when encoding is stopped. But Opencore does not. it probably is a timing issue. Please also make sure that there is no regression caused by this patch.

AV Sync is fine when you do just playback. But after seek, there is no sync what so ever.. Checkout these 3 clips.

i am going to approve this patch as is. let this be the baseline.
i see the need for a few changes:
  - some things that were removed on donut have crept back in.
  - i may change the supported FPS list to include camcorder SRs
and some more

i will submit another patch with those changes.

if preview works with this patch, could you also please submit a patch to disable camera stub.
|This logic may be needed in startPreview(). Please submit another patch to incorporate it. i am not submitting it because i dont know why it was removed.

Good idea, Jean.

Minor corrections:

Please remove 'videoout=omap24xxvout'. Not needed for 25x.

Is there quotes around “0:4M”? even if it does, it does not appear to be the right type.

How to make sure that the integrator uses this file?

I had to revert several patches because otherwise the PV patch does not apply cleanly.

Even with this patch, audio and video goes out of sync when you do FF or REW in a fast manner. That is, if you press the FF/REW button 2 times really quick, then the sync is lost. But it is due to an issue with the getPosition API. After a FF/REW, the getPosition API must restart from 0. But it does not reset sometimes. This causes the clock correction logic to misbehave. I can explain further to whomever will be working on the Audio Flinger.

Although this patch does not fix all AV Sync issue, I still think we need to take it, because it fixes some of the bugs in the previous PV patches. James quoted &quot;Last patch had a bug where the newly created thread would spin and this would slow down the entire phone.&quot; Refer to https://pvjira.pv.com/browse/TIANDROID-40 for more information.

I have tested for non-720p clips. i did not notice any regression. Sorry, I didnt have time to test 720P.
|I meant:
After FF/REW, the getPosition API must return 0 as the framecount.

I am ok with the changes.

But i am a little concerned that the changes we made for the customer has not been fed back to our release line in a systematic manner.

Jean,

I know that you are not in favor of merging this patch. You would rather add these 2 lines in your build process. But it will make our life easy to have those 2 lines there. We can just tell the outside world to uncomment those 2 lines. Less chances of mistakes.

you can merge this patch and still do what you want to do.

Please pull in this patch and patch 2818 (already merged, i think) and verify camcorder functionality. 

We should not see any regression. Recall that these were the issues previously observed:

Pauses in video in the beginning.

Jose,

From the side-by-side diff, it is not very clear what you are trying to do. i dont like the new editor. Anyways, it looks like you commented out the whole function and the buffer size is always w * h. it does not depend on the MacroBlocks/CPB.

I feel that this patch is undoing some optimization that we had done before. Didnt MOT complain about the buffer size and so we had reduced it? Now we are going back to the old size?

Tyler,

You are right about the race condition. Sunita pointed it out as well. It is being dealt with in cameraHal.

Didnt add mutex in overlay (queueBuffer and dequeueBuffer calls) to avoid the race condition because we dont know how it will impact performance.

This logic might be changed later.

|Patch Set 1:

Your patch sparked an idea. We could do it this way:

The goal is to keep at least 2 buffers in the overlay at all times. It is ok to enable streaming after queueing just one buffer.

Replace buf_count with frame_count to make it more meaningful.

Initialize frame_count in createOverlay() and in disable_streaming().

Increment frame_count in overlay_queueBuffer() after the buffer has been successfully queued.

In overlay_queueBuffer() replace this 'if' condition 

if ( ctx-&gt;shared-&gt;qd_buf_count &gt;= NUM_BUFFERS_TO_BE_QUEUED_FOR_OPTIMAL_PERFORMANCE &amp;&amp;  
   (ctx-&gt;shared-&gt;streamEn == 0))

with 

if ( ctx-&gt;shared-&gt;streamEn == 0)


In overlay_dequeueBuffer(), replace this 'if' condition

if ( ctx-&gt;shared-&gt;qd_buf_count &lt;= 1 )

with

if ( ( ctx-&gt;shared-&gt;qd_buf_count &lt;= 1 ) &#124;&#124; (ctx-&gt;shared-&gt;frame_count &lt; NUM_BUFFERS_TO_BE_QUEUED_FOR_OPTIMAL_PERFORMANCE))

Note that qd_buf_count and frame_count server different purposes. qd_buf_count keeps track how many buffers are in the display driver at any time. frame_count keeps track of how many buffers were queued to the display driver after STREAM _ON. frame_count is never decremented.

Sunita,

Does the menu pop up only when we press the OK button or even if we touch the thumbnail?

It is better if it appears only if we press the OK button.

Reason: majority of testing is done on LCD. that should be the default option. Else testers have to press twice to play a clip. it is a big deal when you are testing many clips....

i agree it is trivial..

it is part of the low /high/mms setting.

since the menu setting are going to change, i asked Carlos to submit just this change alone.

later we can add it if necessary.

|Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I read this in the ndk documentation:

  III.2. Android Platform ABI support:
  ------------------------------------
    The Android system knows at runtime which ABI(s) it supports. More precisely, up to two build-specific system properties are used to indicate:
    - the 'primary' ABI for the device, corresponding to the machine code used in the system image itself.
    - an optional 'secondary' ABI, corresponding to another ABI that is also supported by the system image.
    For example, a typical ARMv5TE-based device would only define
    the primary ABI as 'armeabi' and not define a secondary one.
    On the other hand, a typical ARMv7-based device would define the primary ABI to 'armeabi-v7a' and the secondary one to 'armeabi'
    since it can run application native binaries generated for both
    of them. 

So should I do this instead:
TARGET_CPU_ABI := armeabi armeabi-v7a
or this... (dont know the right way yet)
TARGET_CPU_ABI := armeabi-v7a
TARGET_CPU_ABI2 := armeabi

I see the package manager using this...

    public static final String CPU_ABI = getString(&quot;ro.product.cpu.abi&quot;);

    /** The name of the second instruction set (CPU type + ABI convention) of native code. */
    public static final String CPU_ABI2 = getString(&quot;ro.product.cpu.abi2&quot;);

Keith,

This bug was discovered when integrating overlay in flash playback. The buffer pointers were passed across process boundaries. Flash and OMX execute in different processes. Because the offset was not passed, all buffers were being mapped to the same physical address. So, even though the virtual address was different for each buffer, they all mapped to the same physical address.

Keith,

In general, I agree with your comments.
However, in this particular scenario, it is not a codec issue. Here's why:

Sometimes, clips may have a few bad frames in the middle and our codec is capable of recognizing the bad frames and ignoring them - with the hope that subsequent frames will be good and that we can continue decoding.

With this particular clip, there are no good frames after a certain point, so, codec returns all the input buffers without decoding them. Therefore, there is no valid output buffer to return either. Therefore, OMXCodec hangs indefitely waiting for a buffer. That is what i am correcting with this patch.

Anu
|Patch Set 5:

OMXCodec is just waiting for an output buffer to become available. Ducati does not have one to provide since the input is junk. Ducati does not report an error because this could be a temporary condition and we may recover from it.
|Patch Set 5:

Keith,
As discussed,

1. I have submitted a patch to Google: 
https://review.source.android.com/#change,22353


2. I have started a conversation with Ducati team on alternate solutions. I have looped you in on it.

3. I verified with Yong that in the case of streaming, AwesomePlayer pauses the whole state machine when it is starved of input. So, this logic will not come into play in that situation.

During normal playback, you should not be hitting this condition at all.

This condition was added to prevent hang during pause, i think. Sreenidhi can provide more details. He had actually submitted a patch to ensure that this condition is met only during pause. Refer to http://review.omapzoom.org/#change,8311

Here are the answers to comments posted on Patch 1:

&gt;&gt;&gt;virtual ~BufferAllocator() {} 
&gt;&gt;&gt;why is this virtual?
Answer: 
http://www.codersource.net/c/c-miscellaneous/c-virtual-destructors.aspx
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/07/127826.aspx

&gt;&gt;&gt; error handling for allocateOutputBuffers() not implemented
Answer: Error handling is not required. If we fail to allocate buffers from v4l2-gfx driver, then we simply continue to request ducati to allocate the buffers – Meaning if allocateOutputBuffers() fails, then we fall back to the old design. In a way, error handling is done by setting the right flags within allocateOutputBuffers().

&gt;&gt;&gt;if (!mBufferAllocator) return UNKNOWN_ERROR;
&gt;&gt;&gt;close mLibHandle before return error?
Answer: it is not necessary since it is taken care of within freeOutputBuffers(). But I incorporated it anyway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;if (mBufferAllocator)  delete mBufferAllocator;
&gt;&gt;&gt;curious which mem to free for this &quot;delete&quot;?
Answer: Verified that the derived class destructor is called.

&gt;&gt;&gt; may be a quirk should be used for this
Answer: I cannot use a quirk since I do not know when a flash usecase is being executed vs some other usecase. I asked Adobe to set some flag in the meta data so that we know when a flash usecase is executed, but they refused to put it in for the moment. That change will go in 2 months later..
|Patch Set 2:

FYI:
Today, flash performance is at 30 fps for WVGA. Our ultimate goal is to be at 30 fps for 1080P. We cannot get there is one big jump because of the many dependencies between adobe/TI/Google. But we still have to makes some improvements for customers going to production in the next few months. As a first step, we are attempting 720p @ 30 fps.

To attain 720p@30 fps, we need this patch.
To achieve 1080p@30 fps, we are going to build on top of this patch (using GFX driver).

Old logic on output buffer allocation:

Gallery use case: 2D Buffers were allocated by TIHardwareRenderer/DSS and passed to OMXCodec. OMXCodec called UseBuffer.

Non Gallery use cases: 1D Buffers were allocated by ducati and passed to OMXCodec. OMXCodec called AllocateBuffer.

New logic on output buffer allocation:

Gallery use case: 2D Buffers were allocated by TIHardwareRenderer/DSS and passed to OMXCodec. OMXCodec called UseBuffer.

Non Gallery use cases: 2D Buffers are allocated by GFX and passed to OMXCodec. OMXCodec called UseBuffer. if buffer allocation by GFX failed, then same as before.

Saket,

For the moment, we are only using the buffers allocated by the V4L2 GFX driver. So, not much to explain here.

Later on, in the case of flash, all post processing(scaling, dither, etc) will be done by the SGX. That use case mandates that we use the V4L2 gfx driver and the other APIs listed here. Currently, there is too much confusion as to what approach and in what time frame it will be done..
|Uploaded patch set 3.
|Uploaded patch set 4.
|Patch Set 4: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve


|Patch Set 4:

I first investigated the Tiler Mem Mngr to see if i can allocate 2D buffers for NV12. Unfortunately, it does not have right APIs for this purpose. Using the current Tiler MemMngr APIs, i will get 2 pointers - one for y and one for uv - since y is 8 bits and uv is 16 bits.
Plus, i will not have all the information (eg: fd) for creating the IMemory pointers for those addresses.

Looks like the dss and gfx drivers perform some trick to get a single pointer for y and uv such that uv is contigous to Y.

Another reason for using gfx is that - in future - we plan to use the SGX for performing certain post processing functions. In that case, it is necessary to allocate buffers using the gfx driver.

These patches are only the first step towards achieving 1080p 30 fps.

Tested flash.

Tested thumbnail generation of clips requiring port reconfig.

This patch replaces all my previous patches on eliminating memcopy.

We are going this route bcos:

1. Change in strategy from Adobe. No GPU build for GB.
2. Giving 2D buffers to upper layers means they need to be careful how they touch the buffer. a simple memcpy will cause faults!
3. 1D appears to be giving better performance..

Adobe is very particular about that. Any change made is tested across multiple devices.

Saket,

At the moment, there is no intention to submit this patch to Google. There are multiple customers developing VTC solution with differing architecture. It is not clear yet what kind of changes [if any] are required in frameworks to support them. In the meantime, we developed our own test app to test simultaneous playback + record and other vtc specific features. This test app is helping us uncover issues not usually seen with Gallery Playback / UI Camera. Plus, since we are trying to steer our customers to use stagefright as much as possible, our application was written to use stagefright. 

For these reasons, I am not comfortable talking to James about this, yet. And, we could like these patches merged so that we can add our test app to the DB testing so as to uncover breaks in functionality as soon as possible.

Sundar,
Since these changes are not trivial, I am willing to run a subset of the camera UTR prior to merging the patch. Please let me know what tests to run.

We were just wondering...

I dont know the reason why you created CameraParametersBase.. But would using the CameraParameters as the base class fulfill your needs and avoid code duplication?
|Patch Set 2:

Was this patch merged to dev branch as well? If not, could we please take care of that as well?
|Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve


|I know from the patch comment that this is to force the correct behavior from the error handling code.  A comment in the code is necessary here since that is not at all obvious from reading the code.

Is there any value in printing an error message of the previous eError value before overwritting it?  That might help in future debugging.  The current debug line is confusing -- it states the error is from LCML_Init where it is actually from LCML_InitMMC -- not your fault but a left over from a previous code fix.
|Same comment as for AAC_Enc 

Also applies to next file.
|Should this be a 100 strings or a 100 chars?
|I think this should be OMX_MEMFREE_STRUCT_DSPALIGN  -- it was allocated with OMX_MALLOC_SIZE_DSPALIGN.

I think this was a problem left over from the original code.
|Is this still used somewhere?  I'll check as I review the rest of the code.

Checked -- we can remove this now.  It is no longer used.
|Isn't this a DSPALIGNed structure in other components?
|Isn't this a DSPALIGNed structure in other components?
|Now included with OMX_AacEnc_Utils.h.  This can be removed.
|I believe this was allocated with OMX_MALLOC_SIZE_DSPALIGN --- it needs to be freed by OMX_MEMFREE_STRUCT_DSPALIGN

Mistake in the original code.
|This can be removed -- it is included by OMX_TI_Common.h
|This can be removed -- it is included by OMX_TI_Common.h
|This can be removed as it shouldn't be used anymore.
|No longer required -- pulled in through OMX_WmaDec_Utils.h and then by OMX_TI_Common.h.  Could leave it in for clarity but shouldn't be required for the compile.
|Again the comment that this should probably be an allocation of 100 chars instead of 100 strings.
|One the things that came up in the comments from Google for Priyesh's original change was that this is an allocation of 100 OMX_STRINGS and should it be an allocation of CHARs
|This line should be removed well as OMX_TI_Debug.h since they are included by OMX_TI_Common.h
|Again the comment about if we are supposed to be creating a string of 100 strings or a 100 chars
|Can we change this to have brackets around the one line.  It is much easier to read if don't do it all on one line.
|Okay -- here we go:  massively picky comment here.

Rather than refer to the &quot;first two warnings&quot; which is a comment that will become out of date, it would be better to explicitly mention them.  That way the comment is more future proof. 

As a fellow developer, I'm delighted to see a comment on where the macros are defined.  Thank you!

Again with the &quot;Invalid&quot; type of warnings, I would have named them explicitly rather than refer to them as a group just to make the comment more future proof.  

Things I'm still wondering about after reading the comment:
I'm curious why DNSAMPLEBR is set to 0x800 -- but I don't know why from the comment. 

I also don't know when to use each mode.  

I'm going to merge the code without any change to the comment but I thought I'd mention what I thought when I read the code.  Please return the favor when I ever get around to submitting something.  :)
|Again a picky comment I'm not holding up the merge on:

What do the variables hold and what are the limits?  I'm reading this without any background knowledge of what is going on.  The comment only tells me it is something to the DSP.  How should I use the new variable -- do I need to populate it or use it at all?
|I would have removed this since it is included in OMX_TI_Common.h.  Just a picky detail -- do not hold the merge based on this.
|This check is no longer necessary.  The OMX_MEMFREE_STRUCT will do the right thing if pTemp_lcml is NULL
|I believe you should be freeing the structure size here -- not just an OMX_U8 pointer.  It should be G711DEC_FrameStruct
|Again this should be G711DEC_FrameStruct instead of OMX_U8
|This should be G711DEC_FrameStruct  -- since that is what the final casting is on 1661 in the previous code.  On the bright side, you were consistent in the code.  :)
|This should have G711ENC_ParamStruct instead of OMX_U8
|replace OMX_U8 with G711ENC_ParamStruct
|replace OMX_U* with G711Enc_FrameStruct
|Replace OMX_U8 with G711ENC_FrameStruct
|Replace OMX_U8 with G711ENC_FrameStruct
|Replace OMX_U8 with G711ENC_FrameStruct
|Replace OMX_U8 with G711ENC_ParamStruct
|This memset is needed by Windows and shoud be optionally included as it is in G711 Decorder.
|Memset is required for Windows.  You will want to use EXTRA_BYTES instead of 256 as well.
|memset is requried for Windows.
|You are missing the freeing of strmAttr and arr in the EXIT for the code to be equivalent.
|Should this be G722ENC_AudioCodecParams instead of OMX_U8
|You'll need an additonal return here if you are going to put the extra mem frees in the EXIT area.
|Doesn't the handle need to be closed before exiting?
|Does the handle need to be closed before exiting?
|Ok, as a newbie, why do we have a function that is checking the status of 3 pointers at the same time? 

Why would I ever want to do that?  I know that isn't code added by this fix but it is being used here.
|Why not just return OMX_ErrorNone here?  That way we have a clear distinction between the error handling code and the regular code.  You can move the OMX_PRINT1 statement up and then have an Error print for the errors.  Seems simpler to understand to me.
|I agree with Rajesh here.  We should remove this if.    Also if I was going to put it, i would use if (pComponentPrivate-&gt;bMutexInitDone != OMX_FALSE) instead.  It is clearer and a fellow programmer I don't have to check if OMX_FALSE is set to zero.
|This looks to be the endif for the UNDER_CE ifndef to me.
|Again this section needs to be removed.
|Will never be true.  In the case of a NULL allocation the above macro will go to EXIT.
|This code will never be run.  if the strmAttr is NULL, it will cause the code to goto to the EXIT label.

This comment applies to all the NULL checking code in this area.  

To get the desired effect, you need to put the print statment in the EXIT area.
|Never run
|Never run

|If we get to this point, we aren't returning the eError we should be returning a success.  So it should be made explicit that this is a success.   As it is written, that is not clear.  I do realize that this is not about code you changed.  :)
|No check of the error messages here?  We aren't even capturing the codes.  Again I realize this isn't just code you have written
|Are we meaning to exit here all the time?  I don't have time to figure it out at the moment.  May  not be an error.
|THis code will never be run.
|this code will never be run
|Where is eError set here?  It isn't obvious to me.  I'm guessing in OMX_DirInput -- a comment would be nice.  Otherwise we are in an error situation and we haven't set the value.
|Should this be before the __PERF_INSTRUMENTATION?  Are we doing anything with PERF if we are failing with an error?  I don't know enough to know.
|Anything to free here?
|will never be true
|Will never be true
|Will never be true
|Will never be true
|Will never be true
|We aren't going to change the error value from its original uninitialized state?  I don't believe that is what we want to do here.  Source:  http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/cpp/cpp_mfc/general/article.php/c6967
|Why the cast only on one side?
|Do we want to do this?  We aren't going to change the value of error at all?
|This shoud be 100*sizeof(Char).

Not going to hold based on this.  Comment for another patch if it hasn't already been submitted.
|This should not be OMX_U8 as the final parameter.  It should be iLBCD_AudioCodecParams -- the cast made on the next line in the original code.
|White space error at the end of this line.
|whitespace error here.
|You are including a .c file here on a relative path.  I don't think this is a good idea.
|Okay what does this mean?  I can guess two scenarios off the top of my head:  
1) I don't need to do anything for any state that isn't listed above in this piece of code -- so I would expect a comment stating the States that was valid for and that I didn't need to do that. 

2) All the states are covered in the previous case statements, in which case we should have an Error message here saying state x is missing code in this area.  That way in the future when someone adds a new state, the code will help us find the problem.
|Okay -- style issue here -- for commandData = -1 we are disabling both the input port and output ports -- I don't know why since no one has said what commandData -1 stands for.  For commandData == 0x1 we are only disabling the output port.  Rather than using the or it would be better to contain the code via the commandData value -- so add the following line in the above if and reduce this if to deal only with the case where commandData = 0x1 -- it is easier to maintain.  By the way, it would be nice to have an explanation what commandData 0x1 and -1 meant.  Ideally we would have this as a enumerated value but if that is not possible, then we should explain what the values mean by comments.
|What do these commandData numbers mean?
|What do these value mean?
|What do these values mean?
|What do these values mean?
|What do these values mean?
|Again we shouldn't have a default followed directly by break.  What does this mean in this context?
|What do the nParam values mean?
|Why remove the intialization?
|You are casting an unsigned value to an integer here.  What does -1 mean?
|Why is pArgs an OMX_U8 variable here and a char other places?
|should be using OMX_MALLOC_SIZE_DSPALIGN
|Okay line_discipline is an unsigned char (0 to 255) and we are putting an integer.  Quite a few values are not going to work correctly.
|Just a comment --- it is unusual for the code to be more descriptive than the documentation.  The variable name is the more descriptive &quot;line_discipline&quot;.  Why not have the error message have at least the same level of detail?
|Why the change from i?  Just curious.
|Okay -- we have 777 here....is there a specific reason for it or can we use the 0770 that the other directories use?
|Again -- do we need 777?
|Shouldn't we be keeping this file as close to Google's version for our customers?
|Looks like a bracket is missing here to me.
|Is there a reason why we are missing a t in the name:  kPreferAllocateBufferOnOutpuPorts?

There is a t missing at the end of Outpu
|This is the only missed place.
|You need to fix the typo in all the places it is referred to.
|Could that cause any problems?
|Forgive the elementary question -- I don't really know the surrounding code -- why does this control have 3 parameters and the previous one (in the if portion) only have 2?
|Francois has commented in a previous patch set that this was set to one and then never set back to 0.  I don't see the set back to 0 either.
|If we are going to introduce a one line change to remove one tab, can we go ahead and remove the others please?
|Please remove the tabs from this file.
|I don't see an OMAP_ENHANCEMENT wrapper around here.  Do we need one?
|whitespace errors.  Please remove the tabs.
|tabs again.
|tab
|tab
|Please remove the abs.
|Please remove the tabs.
|Please remove the tabs.
|tabs
|I don' t see an OMAP_ENCHANCEMENT flag around this.
|What happened to the &quot;CODEC_&quot; in the front?
|Why wasn't this just addressed with brackets?  It looks like there was a bracketting error in the first place.  This looks like a classic case of miss putting the brackets in for a one line if and mess the code up.
|But either it was a line we added in the first place  and didn't have in OMAP_ENHANCEMENT  or we are changing a line of Google's code.
|Changes to frameworks/base need to be encapsulated in OMAP_ENHANCEMENT.
|Why aren't the lines from 1113 to 1128 in the deinit() function?
|A lot of similar 'and' conditions have been replaced in OMAP4 because they are passing with the OMAP_ENHANCEMENT flag only.  Do you want this to be triggered only if OMAP_ENHANCEMENT is true or if both are true?
|Sorry.  I've gone back and looked at the examples and I had missed the additional OMAP3 and OMAP4 code that was merged at the same time.
|Same comment as above:

A lot of similar 'and' conditions have been replaced in OMAP4 because they are passing with the OMAP_ENHANCEMENT flag only.  Do you want this to be triggered only if OMAP_ENHANCEMENT is true or if both are true?
|Ignore this comment.
|We need to follow the Google coding standards.  If statements should have the { at the end of the line.  See:  http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html

I'd like to see a patch just to fix the file.  I'll let this one go through but this file needs to comply with the coding standards.  Can we have a patch just to do that please?
|This is also a violation of Google coding standards.  They require any single line if statements to be one line or surrounded by brackets.
|Is this OMAP3 specific?  If so, please use TARGET_OMAP3.
|Is this OMAP3 specific or just not OMAP4?
|I don't like the continuation line here...
|or here.  I'll edit them out.
|We need to change the comment if we are changing the setting.
|I would submit the code like this:

if (&quot;true&quot;.equals(android.os.SystemProperties.get(&quot;com.ti.omap_enchancement))) {
     Intent intent = new Intent(android.intent.action.OMAP3_CAMERA_BUTTON, null);   
} else {
    Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_CAMERA_BUTTON, null);
}

Why?  Less thinking on part the next person when there is a merge conflict from Google -- the original code is maintained.  You restore IDENTICAL code when you turn off the OMAP ENHANCEMENT flag.
|The point of the SystemProperties function is to provide the code from Google exactly as it had been written originally for customers so they can remove our changes completely. 

While not as elegant as your solution, it would be better to leave the original line of code in as Google wrote it and then to have an complete alternate path of new code.  That way the customers can compare apples to apples and not apples to oranges.
|I don't like this.  This is defined in both CameraHal.cpp and here in OMXCameraAdapter.cpp.

This should be put in a .h file and included in both
|Why do we have two lines the same here?
|Okay this is a bit confusing.  How about:

#ifdef TARGET_OMAP4
#define CACHELINE_BOUNDARY_MEMALIGNMENT 32
#endif
#ifdef TARGET_OMAP3
#define CACHELINE_BOUNDARY_MEMALIGNMENT128
#endif

No need for the else and then the additional check.  That way it is easier to line up the endifs with the ifs.
|This is new code into a Google area....it should be isolated out with the system properties so it can be removed and the original code restored.  Sorry I missed this section with my earlier comments.
|Is this just an OMAP3 change or is applicable for all non OMAP4 changes?
|Okay, this doesn't look like it restores to the original Google code to me.  Shouldn't we have an else with the mem = mDealer[portIndex]-&gt;allocate(def.nBufferSize) by itself.
|The rest of the code is specifically OMAP4 -- is there a reason why this isn't?
|is there a way of overriding this value in an initialiser instead of permanently changing Google's value?  Ideally when we switch our OMAP_ENHANCEMENT flags, we are back to Google code.  This is a customer requirement.
|This needs to be in an OMAP_ENHANCEMENT flag.  Please do not use tabs and comply with Google coding standards.
|Okay this is too many lines of code that are duplicated for just a one line change.  Just put an ifdef around the setting of the offsetUs value.  We could have problems not updating the duplicate code if we find other errors.
|What is a bymbs?  I know I'm getting the max rate of something but I'm not familiar with the acronym.  A Google search doesn't help.
|Okay....do you mean by as in multiplication or by as &quot;in the unit&quot;
I think you mean &quot;in the unit&quot; so I would name the function:

_get_maxrate_in_mbs

That should make it clear to everyone.  Don't worry if your meaning isn't accurate, your English is much better than my version in your language.  :)
|Okay so we have a change that just moves a comment line?  

Can we put this code into Google coding guidelines please?
|Ah....now I see it.....Still not in Google format.  I'll rebase it.
|What is this finishing?

Why am I not seeing a corresponding line where it has been moved from or where the array was started?
|Single line if statements do not comply with Google Coding standards.  Obviously there are some other bits of code that don't comply (see the if (mAnchor == null) line above).  However, Google requires braces around the code.
|Completely new code at this point that is not included in omap.enhancement.  The return line is included in an omap.enchancement but the rest of the code has just appeared.
|Yes, but it doesn't indicate clearly that this entire code has been added by us.  It just means that you return quickly if OMAP.ENHANCEMENT is false.  To me as a customer, I'm left wondering without it being clear.
|Brand new code in here that is not in OMAP.ENHANCEMENT.
|Yup.
|Brand new code in there that is not in OMAP.ENHANCEMENT
|But again when you look at the code, it is not obvious that this is our enhancement.  It will look to someone else as if this code is google code when you read just this function.  They shouldn't have to look at the call to this function to know that is our enhancement.
|This is probably not called without being in an OMAP.ENHANCEMENT but it is not clear from looking at this code that this function is added due to an OMAP.ENHANCMENT.
|Yes, all functions that you have added should make it perfectly clear that they are enhancments.
|Why?
|Why is this not in OMAP_ENHANCMENT?  Overlooked?
|Tabs......
|Why permissions 0666 instead of 0660?
|No single line if statements allowed in Google Code Standards.

|But this line is added for this patch -- it should be wrapped....I did see the namespace for the majority of the code.

Okay now I'm more worried having found the define.  It is defined in more than one place.  These are also defined in ./frameworks/base/media/libstagefright/AwesomePlayer.cpp  

I assume they are related since the names are identical.  If not we need to change the names here.  Maybe we could suggest to Google that they would be better defined somewhere else that could be commonly included?  Like AwesomePlayer.h for instance?

We should at least mention in a comment that they are defined twice and should be kept in sync.
|Not really defining LOG_NDEBUG_TRACE_TI -- defining TI_TRACE() -- I'm not sure it this should be an OMAP_ENHANCEMENT or not --
|I was trying to find it last night but got too tired to keep on looking.  I'm not worried about the function -- the comment is invalid.  Also, I wouldn't use TI myself, I wouldn't have guessed that as a developer.

|Do we have licensing issues here?
|Do we know the coding standard used for this file?
|It obviously isn't in Android Coding standards.  There is no licence in the file, the indentation is dramatically different.  If it has been developed by a third party, do they have a coding standard that they use?
|Not in Android coding standards.  Sundar -- make a decision here... this fits in with the existing coding structure but we are trying to get the code into the standard format.
|Is this necessary?  I thought this was done by the overall build system.

|Please re-write this comment.  It is difficult to understand.
|Picky -- but I'd prefer not to move this variable for future upgrades.  It might cause merge issues the next time we upgrade if the location is changed.  I can see us having the variable re-declared due the merge with Google and then having to deal with a compilation failure due to duplicate definitions.

|Actually I'm trying to get this set of code into Android Coding Style.  hardware/ti/omap4xxx is actually one of our trees imported by Google so it would be good to try to do it.  I'm not holding on the Android Coding Style but just raising it as a issue.  I was falling asleep at 3:17am so I went with it.  :)

The only place I can see it in this file is in an OMAP_ENHANCEMENT area -- which I would suspect is our code not Google's.  Hence we have violated the coding standards twice.  :)

|Same question -- bitwise &amp; instead of &amp;&amp;?  This is what we want?
|bitwise &amp; and not a regular &amp;&amp;?
|Please use Android Coding standards.  Continuing lines -- indent 8 spaces.  There is also traditionally a space between the if bracket and the brace &quot;) {&quot;  not &quot;){&quot;

|Okay the only reference I can see to this function is in services/surfaceflinger/SurfaceFlinger.cpp -- which is wrapped in an OMAP_ENHANCMENT.  Is there a reason for a non-OMAP-ENHANCMENT option here?
|Nothing to show it is an OMAP_ENHANCEMENT

|Again, not isolated out.
|Not sure why the }; are on a separate line -- doesn't seem to link up with other examples.

|I would make this consistent with other lines and have path first and name second since we are already changing the line.
|Okay.  A function above was defined to set the mUnmountInProgress variable, but now we are just setting it directly.  Which method are we going to use?
|Actually I would prefer that to be a separate change -- easy to do.  Do the first change and make a commit in your area.  Do the second one with another commit.  

What do customers do if they want only one of the fixes?
|Okay.  Why doesn't this have an initial value anymore?
|Not in Android Coding Standards
|Needs to be isolated out
|Not isolated out.
|Not isolated out
|So if OMAP_ENHANCEMENT is set to false, then NFC_TI_DEVICE is set to false as well?
|We have a requirement for all of our code in the Android file system to be compiled out by a compile time flag.  This would more correctly be done by:

#ifdef OMAP_ENHANCEMENT
#ifdef NFC_JNI_TI_DEVICE
#else
#if 0
#endif

Or something similar -- I haven't tried it....so there are likely to be errors in it.
|Okay this is a permanent change here...hmm
|Not in Android Coding Style -- needs brackets.  See:  http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#use-standard-brace-style
|Have we complied with:  http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#dont-catch-generic-exception
|To be really picky, there should be a space between else and {.  This applies to the lines below too.
|Put on separate line and then use the extra brackets and 8 space indent.
|Why have we added spaces?
|What effect has this got on the regular Google system.  Our customer who do not use BLUEZ will be stuck with this.
|I missed this before.  We need this to be wrapped in a flag...we are changing Google functionality here -- so we need to have this code isolated out by the flag, not just changed.
|This needs to be wrapped in BLUETI_ENHANCEMENT flag.
|Wrong formatting again.
|Modify the comment with BLUEZ comments afterwards...rather than overwrite Google's comments.
|Missing space.
|Lost a space....please restore to avoid merge conflicts in the future.
|Again wrong formatting
|No braces.
|Wrong formatting
|Not Android Coding standards.
|Why such a huge indent?

|Hmm....what happens with this if it doesn't exist?
|What am I missing here?  It looks like we are duplicating code here when all that changes is an if line?
|Would be better on a different line surrounded by braces.  I assume it doesn't break the 100 character rule...
|Should follow Android Coding Standards and doesn't -- I'm not picking out all the problems here.  It is close ....check for all if statement etc.

|Is this interface change necessary?  If so, justify it.
|brace should be on previous line.
|Weird bracket placement -- weird indentation
|No, we have a requirement to be able to exclude our code with a compile time flag by our customers.  This changes the code permanently.  See all other instances.
|Single line if statements not in coding standards.

|coding standard violation -- I wasn't sure if this has the same standard as the Android Coding standard but the other examples I can find of a single separated line if statement (see lines 134, and  461) have braces around the single line.

Fix braces on if statement to be consistent.
|No tabs
|no tabs
|no tabs
|Again same comment as other patch -- coding standard violation
|Not in Android coding standards -- needs braces
|Again needs braces
|Do we need code isolation here?  It looks like a Google file and I see no wrapper around the code
|No code isolation despite it looking like a Google file.
|Okay.  This isn't the same as the original line where we had a + at the end of the line.   Are you sure this works when we don't have OMAP_ENHANCEMENT is false?
|Not in coding standards....extension lines should be indented 8 characters.
|see above comment
|What is up with the confusing and hard to read indentation here?
|Hmm....class renaming.....not sure I'm happy with the change in the interface here.  Won't there be implications for this?
|Missing space between if and (
|Indent only 3 spaces here
|What is the magic number 250 about?  Just curious.
|Again a magic number with no explanation.
|missing space.
|Okay does this work without the breaks in it?  Because from the looks of it, value gets set to MEDIA_PLAYER_REPEAT_MODE_OFF every single time.
|I don't understand this comment.

What does &quot;during the automotive&quot; mean?  What have cars got to do with it?

Should it be &quot;the AVRCP CT peer device sent only FF push without any release causing us to get stuck in FF&quot;?  

It doesn't quite make sense to me.
|typo?  @linke?
|Again we have a switch statement without any breaks in it.  Doesn't this result in everything being set to MEDIA_PLAYER_SHUFFLE_MODE_OFF?
|Why no indent on these lines -- harder to read like this.
|Okay we  have a magic number without an explanation here.

Why are we doing this?  Why by 1000?
|Not in Android Coding standard -- continuing lines indent 8 characters only.
|indent 8 characters
|Again an indent problem.
|Again....a switch statement with no breaks.
|I'm sure that this one is covered by a comment in an earlier DR.
|This looks like it is applied generically.  If so, has it been submitted to Google?
|missing brackets around single if line -- Not in Android Coding standards.
|100 milliseconds seems like a &quot;magic number&quot;

Please put your understanding of why this magic number is necessary in the code and not just in the comments section of the DR.  That way when the next programmer comes along, they will see why.  They won't normally reference the comments associated in Gerrit, especially if they are a customer.
|Why do we need this ifeq section?  ifneq exists.
|What is the point of this?
|Android coding violation -- requires brackets around single line if statement
|Why are we keeping these lines if they aren't needed?
|No tabs please.

Also no single line if statements.

A DR tells me that someone cared about there being a link from lib to /system/lib – at least enough to file a DR on it.  So, there is at least 1 reason to not have it.  Seems to me the proper solution here is to remove the hard coded paths from the BT code.  That improves the BT code for the future and allows it to work with Android.

 

…Kd


Adding comments from Keith -- based on an email chain.
|Given the status of the DR, I will manually merge it for L25.9RC2.  I'm not going to commit to the tree but we will use it for L25.9 if no alternative can be provided for the release.
|Patch Set 1: No score

I believe this one has already been reworked.  Please abandon it.
|Pavan,

I am merging all the changes that are on the tree at the moment.  493 and 495 will be merged if they successfully merge and compile.  

471 is still on the tree and was pulled in for L25.9.  Even if it is abandoned, it will still be possible to pull it in.  

Given that information, can I abandon 471?

Anu I have merged and compiled this.  It does compile but I'm concerned about Juan's earlier claim that it required the IPP header files.  Is that just a runtime requirement? If so I'll merge this; otherwise this will be a manual merge.  

I'll leave it as a manual merge for now and we can merge it for L25.9RC3 if needed.

Luis,

796 is essentially Anu merging 788 which has already been merged to the tree.  When you see &quot;merged&quot; patches, they are usually when the developer has manually pulled a patch and then submitted their new code.  I don't know the correct way to do this but essentially they are resubmitting the patch that they pulled down.

The one this one is dependent on has already been merged so you will have no net affect from this.

This is on donut and dependent on an eclair patch.  Are you trying to move the original patch to donut with this?
|Patch Set 1: No score

Hmmm...theoretically the dependency should be okay since the code is identical but I will end up rebasing this to break the dependency.  Is there a reason why this has been done in eclair rather than donut?
|Sorry it was one of the earlier dependencies that was eclair.
|Okay, I think I see what is going on.  This is patch set 2 for 1551 which was done on eclair rather than donut.  

Here's how I'd fix it.  

1) pull down the 1551 code in eclair.
2) create a separate donut repository.  
3) Compare the files in the two directories using something like BeyondCompare and ensure you aren't going to overwrite anything with your changes.  The result of this will create &quot;merged&quot; files.
4) Copy the &quot;merged&quot; files to donut.  
5) Create a new patch with these files.
6) Abandon this change and 1551 listing the new patch number.

|It isn't a good idea to introduce redundant code based on what might happen in a code rewrite.  The code should be based on what we currently have.  If you were in the middle of rewriting the macros yourself, then these changes would be made after the introduction of the new macros.
|Rework the patch and remove the code please.  We can't anticipate what future code will look like.  The code will have different macro names at the least.

Just take the redundant code out and resubmit the rest of the patch.

Can I get a quick answer to the question of why we only have a cast on one side please?
|This is the wrong fix then.  The value of nParam will never be -1 so why is the previous programmer trying to compare an unsigned int with a negative value?  That is the problem to solve.  What has been done just gets rid of the error that points out the logic flaw but it doesn't fix it.

Why was fw3a the first name and why has it changed to fw3a_core?  If it was always called fw3a_core and renamed, why did we start to change it to fw3a?

In the future we need more information in the description.  The description doesn't tell me anything.  If I put my customer hat on this is what I come up with: What does KW stand for?  Why do I care about this patch?  Why did you even change anything?  Should I pull it into my build if I'm only taking certain patches.  The description should provide all those details. 


I'm not going to hold the patch on this but I'll start doing that in the 2 week break between releases in the future.

Okay what is going on with this patch?  It has asked that someone verify this patch and let us know that it works.  This request has been there since April.  This patch is being referred to in the handoff this month so just leaving it an unmergable state is not a good idea. 

Patches should not be manually merged into a release so if you ever want this to go out the door it needs to be verified.

Please address the issues raised in this patch as soon as possible.  

I will come back to this patch in a week.  If the verification has not been done by then, I will abandon the patch.

Rajesh, please check over the code carefully.  I had merge conflicts in the audio/src/openmax_il/wma_dec/tests/WmaDecTest.c file.  The non-trivial one was the following:

            case 4: /* Just Stop */
                    if(frmCount == 10) {
                        printf (&quot; Sending Stop command to Codec \n&quot;);
                        StopComponent(pHandle);
***********merge conflict had a break at this point *******

There were comments made on this DR and then reversed to allow for a later patch.  This is really not a good practice.  Lets just fix it here.  

Why?  Other patches can be bumped in priority.  They will not be correlated with the current patch.  So what we do is deliberately introduce an error.  

Please fix the issues raised in this DR.  I'll change my status when they are addressed.

This patch is in a circular dependency with 3880 according to Gerrit.  When I try to cherry-pick 3880 it says it is dependent on this patch.  This patch is a dependency for 3843 which in turn is a dependency for 3880. 

When try to cherry-pick this one to break the dependency, then I'm getting a merge conflict:

Is this really a good idea?  It looks like from the code that the size of this variable is going to start to change with the application's request sometime in the future.  

Are we going to be able to enable camera burst capture optionally for applications in the future when that change happens and the memory is less than our requirement?

This patch needs reviewers.
|Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

We need to isolate our changes in Google areas, specifically in frameworks base. Here is the new requirement based on customer feedback: 

Each of the patches needs to be revisited (commit list attached). If it just added functionality – then all is needed is some #ifdef added. If it replaced, deleted, or modified the code – then the original code needs to be put back and the TI code #ifdef. I don’t need a meeting for that. 



We will use the define – OMAP_ENHANCEMENT. So the code would look like 

#ifdef OMAP_ENHANCEMENT 

&lt;some nice ti change&gt; 

#else 

&lt;previous Android (assuming the change modified the original code) 

#endif 



Android.mk files in affected area’s will need to have the following in it 

Ifneq (,$(findstring omap, $(TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM))) 

LOCAL_CFLAGS += -DOMAP_ENCHANCEMENT 

endif 


Please rework as appropriate.

This is hard code to see where the ifs start and end.  I can't see (without printing out the code) which endif goes with which if once the code is split by lines.  Next time it might be good to label the endif with the if that started them to improve readability -- for instance:

#ifdef TARGET_OMAP4 
 if(!isTICodecComponent) 
{ 
#endif 
// release the OMX buffer 5398 // release the OMX buffer 
 iOutBufMemoryPool-&gt;deallocate(pContext); 5399 iOutBufMemoryPool-&gt;deallocate(pContext); 
 return OMX_ErrorNone; 5400 return OMX_ErrorNone; 
  
#ifdef TARGET_OMAP4 
 }  // if (!isTICodecComponent)
else 
{ 
 pBufdata += copylen; 
 bufLen -= copylen; 
 }  // if (!isTICodecComponent)
#endif 


There is a dangling do that with a quick glance, I can't see where it ends.

We need to isolate our change in Google areas, specifically in frameworks base. Here is the new requirement based on customer feedback: 

Each of the patches needs to be revisited (commit list attached). If it just added functionality – then all is needed is some #ifdef added. If it replaced, deleted, or modified the code – then the original code needs to be put back and the TI code #ifdef. I don’t need a meeting for that. 



We will use the define – OMAP_ENHANCEMENT. So the code would look like 

#ifdef OMAP_ENHANCEMENT 

&lt;some nice ti change&gt; 

#else 

&lt;previous Android (assuming the change modified the original code) 

#endif 



Android.mk files in affected area’s will need to have the following in it 

Ifneq (,$(findstring omap, $(TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM))) 

LOCAL_CFLAGS += -DOMAP_ENCHANCEMENT 

endif 


Please rework as appropriate.

Sunita,  I'm not able to rebase this as this patch is providing no changes.  The code on the tree already seems to have this fix.  Can you look into it and decide if this patch needs to be abandonded or not?

We need to isolate our change in Google areas, specifically in frameworks base.  Here is the new requirement based on customer feedback:

Each of the patches needs to be revisited (commit list attached).  If it just added functionality – then all is needed is some #ifdef added.  If it replaced, deleted, or modified the code – then the original code needs to be put back and the TI code #ifdef.  I don’t need a meeting for that.

 

We will use the define – OMAP_ENHANCEMENT.  So the code would look like

#ifdef OMAP_ENHANCEMENT

&lt;some nice ti change&gt;

#else

&lt;previous Android (assuming the change modified the original code)

#endif

 

Android.mk files in affected area’s will need to have the following in it

Ifneq (,$(findstring omap, $(TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM)))

LOCAL_CFLAGS += -DOMAP_ENCHANCEMENT

endif


Please rework as appropriate.

Yes, the daily build system already has this incorporated.  However, that doesn't help all the developers using the generic manifest to do their development.  I have modified the generic manifest to allow them and me to compile the patches that coming in.  Without modifying the generic manifest to fixed points, we are breaking the generic build.

|Patch Set 2:

Ricky I can confirm that this happens on OMAP4.  I can reproduce it easily.
|Patch Set 2:

The issue that I see is the following (just in case it isn't clear to others):

You fast forward or rewind the playback (mp3 or AV) and when you resume at the new position, you get a small portion of playback from the previous position.  Pausing the clip is unnecessary but highlights the problem.

To reproduce:  take any mp3 or AV playback that you know well.  Fast forward to a very noisy and distinct part of the clip.  Then seek back to a different position (you can use pause just to make it easier -- it makes no difference).  You will hear a very small portion of sound from the &quot;noisy distinct part of the clip&quot; before you hear the sound from the new part of the clip start up.  Using pause makes it easier to hear but makes no difference to reproducing it since you can do it just with the seek.

I'm not merging at this time for the following reasons:

1) there are a lot of legacy formats in include/hardware/hardware.h that have been included outside of a OMAP_ENHANCEMENT section.

2) There are also a number of changes, new enums values and new enums in include/hardware/overlay.h  without OMAP_ENHANCEMENT flags around them.  Also, there are number of tab errors in the files.

Thanks,

|Patch Set 1: Do not submit

I can't accept a 2370 line patch.  Break this up into the original Froyo patches.  We need to maintain the history.

No one can effectively review a patch this big.
|Patch Set 1:

Julian there are 3725 lines of change over approproximately 70 lines of files (not including the files that have been added).

This change is too big for anyone to effectively review or comprehend.

From a customer perspective, I have no idea which patches from Froyo have been ported to Gingerbread.  I have no idea which ones have been modified and how.  If I have rejected a few patches from Froyo, I have no idea what to do to match up the Gingerbread environment with this environment.

From a debugging perspective, I can't revert portions of this patch if there is a problem with it.

This patch is too big.

The correct way to port is to maintain the patch history, port each patch and modify each one as you go.
|Patch Set 1:

Muthu, what is your opinion on this?
|Patch Set 1: No score

Can this be rebased?  I'll merge it after the rebasing.

Jean

This is a confusing message.  But if you look carefully you will see that the merge conflict message came from Gerrit.  This means that the file has changed too much between when it was originally created and when it was attempted to be merged.  Essentially a rebase is required.  

I will go through the rest of the list to see the status and then I will try to attend to the remaining patches.

Ricky this is original google code.  If we are are going to remove it, we need to use an ifdef !OMAP_ENHANCEMENT.

Can I have some reviews on this patch or a verification.  Julian, if it is just a rebase, can you let me know?  Thanks.
|Patch Set 3:

Hi Julian, in Gerrit you can only upload the last patch set.  So if there was a need to upload patch set 2 instead of patch set 3, we would have to create a new patch set 4 from patch set 2.  However, since patch set 2 and 3 are identical, I can just merge patch set 3.  

Thanks for the reply.

Yes, the suggested code and the code that has been written do identical things.  However, I'm looking at this from a code merge perspective.

This is in a Google area and therefore needs to be able to be isolated out by OMAP_ENHANCEMENT.  We need to be able to alternate between our new code and the original Google code.

Thanks,

duplicate variable definitions -- please put in a .h file and include in both places.
|Patch Set 19:

So it has been removed from CameraHAL.cpp....is it not needed there?
|Patch Set 19: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

So it is still defined in two different places -- now it is Camera_HAL.h and OMXCameraAdapter.cpp.  

These have the potential to get out of date.
|Uploaded patch set 21.
|Patch Set 21: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

Removed MAX_MANUAL_GAIN_ISO definition from
camera-omap4/src/OMXCameraAdapter/OMXCameraAdapter.cpp. It was a duplicate definition. The variable is already defined in CameraHal.hwhich is included in camera-omap4/inc/OMXCameraAdapter/OMXCameraAdapter.h.

Is this just an OMAP3 change or applicable to all other platforms?
|Patch Set 2:

Please change the line so that it is dependent on TARGET_OMAP3 being set then.  It will ensure that the line is only done for OMAP3.
|Patch Set 2:

Please resubmit a new patch set with the relevant line being inside TARGET_OMAP3.  It will ensure that the line is only done for OMAP3.

If not then the change should be made in an overlay so that it will apply only to the boards that it applies to.

Tons of Google Code Standard errors in the code.  Essentially single line if statements are not allowed.  There are tons in all the files.

Alberto, no sorry I don't have a script that does it yet.
|Patch Set 5:

Thanks very much Alberto....it took longer to skim through the code than it did to comply.

Tony, I used your command and found only 1799 instances of a if statement without a { at the end -- I took the wc -l off your comment and I gave up looking through them at 294 lines.  All of the lines to that point either single line if or else if statements with the exception of a couple of lines with if the comments.  So the coding standards were still maintained.  Single line if statements are allowed -- just not ifs with the line underneath included without bracket/braces around it.
|Patch Set 5:

Because I may not have been clear:

if (condition) do this; 

is allowed

if (condition)
   do this;

is not.

The ones from Google matched:  if (condition) do this;

As the integrator, I advise that Ivanov and Alberto get together to have a discussion about the names.  I will not be merging this patch until there has been a resolution on the naming issue.

|Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

No OMAP_ENHANCEMENTs in the patch.  Please refer to the following page:

 

https://gforge01.dal.design.ti.com/gf/project/omapandroid/wiki/?pagename=OMAP_ENHANCEMENT+code+usage


Also will all these enhancements work for all board types:  Panda, Blaze, Blaze_tablet, customer boards?
|Patch Set 3: (11 inline comments)

I've marked areas in the java code which do not have OMAP_ENHANCEMENT in the code.  They should be in OMAP_ENHANCMENT.

XML files can be tackled by overlays if they don't apply to all boards; hence, the question.  However, they must apply in all scenarios if an overlay is not the solution.  So it must work on Panda and customers boards.

Please refer to the following page:

The patches are not in Google Coding Standards.  I've looked through the rest of the files and it looks as if they are mainly in that style with a few exceptions.  The main errors are the bracketing style.

Here's the Google coding link: https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/opensource/submit-patches/code-style-guide
 -- Yes it says Java Coding style but it used for all the C and C++ files.
|Patch Set 2: (4 inline comments)

Still not in Google Style...that applies to all the files.

Patch sets 4 to 8 -- reformating of the file into Google Coding standards.  No other changes make.  Jack is going to reverify the patch before it is merged.

I'm assuming this is licensed code so this needs to be tarred up.  Look at the ducati and graphics examples in the same directory as examples.

If it proprietary code, it needs to be tarred so that the license is downloaded with the code everytime.  This is a legal requirement.

|Patch Set 4:

When using acronyms in descriptions, please ensure that you have expanded it at least in one of the usages.  I'm assuming that a PLD is a programmable logic device. 

In computer science many acronyms have multiple meanings so expanding the first usage helps to eliminate confusion.  

Here's how I would re-write your note:  

Note: Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) are platform dependent. The original implementation treats the cache line size as 64 bytes.  With this modification and additional PLDs, bionic memory throughput increases for L2 cache from 1597 MB/s to 2674 MB/s for 64 KB data.

Okay the biggest problem here seems to be that you are using an editor which replaces tabs with spaces.  I would turn that feature off in the editor and then rework the patch to get rid of all the lines in the change that have nothing to do with the actual change that you are doing.

It looks like you have reworked the real changes that you have done correctly.

Take all the tabs rework out because is it done poorly and then redo that in a later patch.

That way, this patch concentrates in on the actual fix done.

On a previous discussion on FaceUnlock, the following statement was provided by Akshay Agarwal:

Note that this cannot be delivered to customers. This is part of the GMS package and OEMs should have their own GMS package from Google.

I'm going loop Akshay in on this patch.  Putting into -1 for now until I hear back from him.
|Patch Set 2:

I can't find Akshay as a user in the system.  I'll have to pursue this via email.
|Patch Set 2: No score

I've received a reply on the previous FaceUnlock email chain from Anand Gadiyar:

The face-unlock APK is the one that cannot be delivered. This comes from the GMS package that Akshay mentioned. This package needs to be obtained by customers directly from google - the xmls that were uploaded in this patch are not part of GMS.

Anything we do in our AFS code to enable face-unlock should be fine.

On a separate note, thanks for pointing out the patch - I was wondering why face unlock doesn't work on our devices yet :)

|Patch Set 10:

Do we have a coding standard from Google for HWC?
|Patch Set 10:

When you are programming, that can be a reasonable approach.  When you are integrating over the entire Android File system, then you are dealing with at least 20 trees and sometimes 40 to 60 patches in a day and reading each individual file to try to figure out the coding standard for each file is not a reasonable approach. 

Ideally we will get an automatic coding standard checker in place at some point -- that will never be able to read the code to find out the coding standard.  It would just reject the file automatically.

I have proposed in an email to you that files which do not follow the Android Coding Standards have a line at the top below the license that indicates the standard used.  That way, we can have any automatic checker search for that in the file, and it will know not to automatically reject the file.  

Obviously this will only apply to files in which we collaborate with third parties who have their own coding standards for the files.  Otherwise, we would expect the files to comply with Android Coding Standards.

This approach would enable an automatic checker to be developed and also allow for integrators and developers to have a quick way to check a file for a different coding standard.
|Patch Set 10:

The problem with applying new standards to any new modules is that this makes it more difficult to push any new modules up to Android in the future.  

Android Coding Standards will apply unless a third party is involved and code is being passed back and forth.

Please read the Android Coding Standards:  http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html

Specifically the following sections:  http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#use-standard-brace-style

and 

http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#use-spaces-for-indentation

I'm also very concerned about the interface change.  Is there no other way around it?
|Patch Set 2:

If this is for the beta release, then it is also on the wrong branch.

What about the affect on OMAP4 blaze_tablet, blaze and OMAP5?

Is GPS broken for all our variations?
|Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The best way to do this is by an overlay xml file instead of modifying the xml file directly.  You need to create a .xml file in the same directory structure under device/ti/blaze_tablet/frameworks/base/data/etc/android.hardware.location.gps.xml

That should override the existing .xml file without making changes directly to the .xml file.

Duplicate of 20662/10 on the dev branch.  This patch will provide consistency between the branches on the number of patches required to produce the code.  

Originally two patches were created to do this change. On the dev branch the two patches were combined into 20662/10 and so to keep the debugging efforts the same between the branches, we are using the same Change ID and patches on both branches.

Can we have the following check instead -- to eliminate OMAP3 and customer boards?


Only applicable for OMAP4 and OMAP5 boards.
# First eliminate OMAP3 and then ensure that this is not used
# for customer boards
ifneq ($(TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM),omap3)

|For test purposed, I had only enabled I2C bus 2 to use the hw spin locks, will change it for all busses.

Besides, this change is to only display a line on the console to the user to indicate that usbboot is looking for an omap4 or omap5 device.

|well, this should be argv[4].
the return of &quot;wc filename&quot; is two values i.e. size of filename and filename.
so the string no_gp_hdr or add_gp_hdr is contained in argv[4] and not argv[3]
|white space.
|move it to a header file?
|where does OMAP44xx_BOOT_DEVICE get populated?
|isn't this code unreachable in case the previous case FAILS?
to get there you will have to remove the return statement above.
|I am not sure what is the need for this change. Seems like you are trying to init the emmc in any case (below) and you're using mmc_slot for that.
|I am doing a memcmp because I return back a string.
|i dont plan to change it.
|this is used to malloc some space for the file read.
|yes, we could.
|see makefile comments.
|The reason for copying this to the main directory is because in the DB when we run usbboot, everything is the same parent folder and not in sub folders.
|Note, I am not renaming. I am copying and renaming.
|see above.
|Personally, I don't want to handle it differently for GP and EMU because from the DB perspective, it is easier to have two files packaged i.e. iboot_GP.ift and iboot_EMU.ift. This keeps it simple and reduces confusion.
|this is not a bug fix. we don't want to open the usb handle twice.. see below.
|bryan, look at the original file to see what has changed. this comment is incorrect.
|don't you need to include scale_vcores in this check?
|Based on Dan's comment, yes, i think we should have a check to see if the downloaded binary will fit. This might be a good place to check.
|should we call this something generic instead of ABOOT_VERSION?
|yes, i think we can change it to something like this:

if (user_fastboot_request)
 call do_fastboot()
|i didn't notice that this was added. this shouldn't be here.
|these registers are part of omap, so i dont think they are board specific:
CM_WKUPAON_KBD_CLKCTRL and keypad registers.

this part can be moved to board specific file:
#define USER_FASTBOOT_RQ (KEY_VOLUME_UP &#124; KEY_VOLUME_DOWN)
since  USER_FASTBOOT_RQ might be different for different boards.
|what does dbt stand for?
|what is sectors_eighth?
|James, you don't have a header defined. Maybe you can change this to:

Fasboot.sh: Add steps to flash omap5

Modify the existing fastboot.sh in the omap5evm/boot directory with the correct steps to successfully flash omap5 using usbboot and also to detect and flash GP or HS devices.
|rem should be remove
|what is the point of this func?
|you're adding a ptn when no_test_ptn =0?

|add a newline
|can you check and see what does sizeof(struct mmc_devicedata) return?
as far as i know this is quite big and that is why these two lines were added:

|Done. fixed in next version of the patch.
|i think this comment applies to 5430 as well, will change it.
|subject line needs to be more specific
|The description seems misleading. You need to indicate that the change is related to the fact that OMAP4 / eMMC should be using at most 8b/SDR/19.2.
|comment no longer applies
|change to &quot;DDR width&quot;

Also, change the comment to reflect the CLOCK DIVIDER change as well.
|The DEVICE_XXX should stay with the rest since it is part of a set. 
Only add the MMCSD_ defines here.
|subject could be:
omap4: eMMC: should use 8bit, SDR mode and 19.2MHZ clock divider
|Description: OMAP4 was using the incorrect data rate and clock divider for eMMC. 	OMAP4 eMMC should be using at most 8b/SDR/19.2MHz. This patch fixes that.
|I don't see why all of this needs to be moved to add 4 lines which are not DEVICE_XXX related!

Why not do something like this?

#if defined CONFIG_IS_OMAP4
#define MMCSD_WIDTH_SUPPORTED	MMCSD_8BIT_BUS_WIDTH_SUPPORTED
#define MMCSD_CLOCK_DIVIDER	MMCSD_CLOCK_DIVIDER_19_2MHZ

#elif defined CONFIG_IS_OMAP5
#define MMCSD_WIDTH_SUPPORTED	MMCSD_8BIT_DDR_BUS_WIDTH_SUPPORTED
#define MMCSD_CLOCK_DIVIDER	MMCSD_CLOCK_DIVIDER_48MHz

|i built with sparse and didn't see a sparse warning. i don't think the device name will be bigger than 12. would you prefer a define for the size instead?
|missing change id and commit message
|i don't see how get_reset_reason is the same as pmic_enable?
|shouldn't we remove include/config.h and include/version.h?
|can we not reuse the dd from mmcd?
|what is 0x224?
|should be libsparse:
|Based on our discussion, looks like Google always had this field set to be 32 bits. This would mean that what we had in omapboot from the very beginning was incorrect.

You can add this link in the commit message as a reference:
http://git.omapzoom.org/?p=platform/system/core.git;a=blob;f=libsparse/sparse_format.h;h=c41f12a545c9952d2ab803779af89916ea00618e;hb=refs/heads/master
|i don't think this is correct. chunk_sz used to be 16 bits at one point and that was working fine. google changed it to be 32 bits at some point for a reason. we need to find that commit and refer to it here. saying chunk_sz was incorrectly defined is misleading.
|Vish, use a define like CLKSEL_SOURCE_192MHZ as the value instead of L3INIT_CTRL_FIELD_MASK. It would make the change clear to understand.

Since you are removing the check on force_mem_out in isp_csi2_try_pipeline(), do we need to have it defined in isp_cs2.h? Or should we move it to isp.h as that is the only other place we are using it: 
drivers/media/video/isp/isp.c	
2295 a-&gt;value = isp-&gt;isp_csi2.force_mem_out ? 1 : 0;
2348 isp-&gt;isp_csi2.force_mem_out = new_value ? true : false;

Atanas, this check &quot;if (previous_power == V4L2_POWER_ON)&quot; is required to prevent disabling the clock if the power state is OFF or standby. If you remove this check, you may see a warning during suspend-resume.
|Patch Set 1:

Atanas, removing this check will cause the suspend-resume path to fail; we have seen this happen. You can test it at your end and verify.

To answer your question:
When you transition from V4L2_POWER_ON to V4L2_POWER_STANDBY, we check if prev power state was ON and then disable cam_mclk.

When you transition from V4L2_POWER_STANDBY to V4L2_POWER_OFF, the cam_mclk was already disabled, so no need to decrement the usecount; as it is already 0.
|Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)

If you plan to separate out the case for V4L2_POWER_STANDBY and V4L2_POWER_OFF, then that is fine. It does make sense to have separate logic for both.

24 and 33 seem redundant as well as 25 fps gets selected when you request for 24 and 30 gets selected when you ask for 33.
The only way to actually get 5, 24 or 33 fps is if we skip the negotiation process and set the fps directly using the set param ioctl.

Patch set 1 had some build errors relating to the inclusion of memmgr.h and tiler.h in files camera-omap4/src/ImageEncoder/ImageEncoderTest.cpp and camera-omap4/src/ImageEncoder/OMXImageEncoder.cpp

Patch set 2 fixes it with these changes in camera-omap4/src/Android.mk

James, there is a fastboot.sh in device/ti/omap5sevm/boot
|Patch Set 1:

I think it should be possible to have just one to support all versions of silicon.
|Patch Set 2:

how about you have an api to get_boot_slot() which returns back the device and use that when we make a call to the rom_mmc apis? that way you dont have to declare device in eboot.
|Patch Set 2:

Adding what we discussed here -
Instead of using a function like board_flash_slot_init() to setup device=something, have two functions like get_boot_slot() and set_boot_slot() and setup device=something in the board files outside of an API.
get_boot_slot() can be used before we need to read the device and set_boot_slot() can be used to set the device based on user preference.

FAILS on HS devices.
|Patch Set 1:

Fairuz, that is exactly what I was trying to do. First I tested your patch and it worked on a GP wakeup board and on the GP UEVM (panda-omap5) but it FAILED on HD/HS SEVM. We need to understand why it's failing and fix it. This patch or any variant cannot be merged until then.
|Patch Set 1:

The I2C write FAILS, this usually happens when there is no response before the specified timeout. I increased the timeout and and still saw it FAIL.

Will give it a try on another HD board to see if the behavior is the same.

kevin, i split the original patch into 2: ddr framework (this one) and http://review.omapzoom.org/#/c/25982/ for ddr3. i did mention it earlier.

this patch has to be modified to include vikram's comments, see patch set 1.

the reason uevm didn't compile for you with this patch is because it had not been updated then. pull the updated version and try. it will work now.

|Patch Set 5:

Aneesh to answer your Q, &quot;Is it not better to decide between NO_INIT_USB and INIT_USB depending on the boot mode rather than whether it's iboot or eboot. Why not allow eboot to work in peripheral preferred bootmode and iboot to work in memory preferred boot mode.&quot;

As of today, iboot only gets used with usbboot i.e. in peripheral boot mode and eboot only gets used in memory boot mode. In peripheral boot mode, we can reuse the existing usb connection and hence don't need to init the usb, so NO_INIT_USB is being used.

There are some changes being made to support the 2 stage boot and it's possible that your comment will apply there.
For now though, since iboot is only used in one mode, I thought it best to keep the changes simple.
|Patch Set 5:

Aneesh, I believe we answered some part of this Q on email today. We don't support Windows flashing. You may make changes as needed to support the use-case you want. Otherwise, we recommend using omapflash on Windows.

|Patch Set 1:

Dan, the only way to access this proc_get_proc_id would be through boot_ops. I tried passing in boot_ops to the set_flash_slot api. The return type of set_flash_slot() is storage_ops which gets called in fastboot.c
The problem is fasboot used fbdata so when I return boot_ops-&gt;storage ops to fbdata-&gt;storage_ops, the compiler complains.

Other way to do this is to  remove omap44xx_l4_per_hwmod but this need not be done as this file is auto-generated and L4 access is available in the hardware. Hence hwmod database shall still continue to have omap44xx_l4_per_hwmod.
|omap5 check is not required as the board file passes the required i2c client info which would not be there for non OMAP5 boards.
|hdmi_ip_data is used only for HDMI Registers details. The phy value that is being passed is a clock value and is not used across many functions. It is used only here and in hdmi_power_on() from where hdmi_ti_4xxx_phy_init() is called. Hence I think that it is not required to be part of hdmi_ip_data struct but can be passed as a parameter.
|Wondering why r shall be made zero. Any harm if returned as error?

Because of r made zero, sync_drop might not happen if sync object is there even though the composition has failed. If sync object is not there, the caller will not get to know that the composition apply failed.

|I guess you did not notice the &quot;for&quot; loop. Within for loop we would be acquiring the lock and without releasing it we will try to acquire it again. Also we cannot do spinlock outside for loop as that is the original implementation.
|But that was the original implementation which will result in nested spinlock. Otherwise we need to unlock it before disable overlays and lock it after disable overlays which is similar to this. Please note that the op private data is accessed under spinlock inside ovl-&gt;disable.
|No, There is a &quot;op&quot; private data access inside the if condition which requires the lock and the mp private data access outside which again requires one. Inorder to have synchronised lock and unlock, it can be handled like this only.

|I guess this must be Errata ID: i740?. It is good to mention OMAP5 ES1.0
|and OMAP5 too
|Why do you want to maintain a local runtime count? pm_runtime_* maintains the count internally.
|OMAP4, OMAP5 ES1.0?
|How does this work? is there a ../clockdomain.h in drivers/video/omap2/?
|OMAP5 too.
|ok
|ok. will do.
|This is not part of the Errata, but an observation from a specific customer. Hence unless we have verified on such a small display, we can't say if it exists. Hence I've carried ported it for OMAP4 as such and did not extend it for OMAP5.
|ok
|No, But I do not want to miss the patch from OMAP4 for a very small display. This was reported by customer and not sure if it exists for OMAP5. So until it is reported, we won't limit the feature from software. Moreover, the patch description says only for smaller displays not the errata. Errata part handling is coded with proper comments.
|Copy paste Typo. Will correct it.
|But isn't the subject of the errata very clearly mentioning DSI in it? Doesn't that explain it?
|In Errata doc, the subject says &quot;DSI: Minimum Of 2 Pixels Should Be Transferred Through DISPC Video Port&quot;. It is only for DSI. The description says &quot;Minimum number of pixels for MIPI command mode from the video port should be greater than 1 (at least 2). Image with less than 2 pixels is not expected to be used in a real applicative use case.&quot; So what does MIPI command mode mentioned in the description? I could infer it as DSI command mode only! That is why the initial check before entering this point is for DSI command mode only. Am I missing something here?
|The errata says:
Minimum number of pixels for MIPI command mode from the video port should be greater than 1 (at least 2). So it is only for command mode
|I guess, this condition is practically impossible and it should also return error. So the extra check is not required.
|:-) What I am saying is info-&gt;width * info-&gt;height &lt; 2 is info-&gt;width * info-&gt;height == 0 condition covered. So we need to return error for width/hght=0 too as width or height in a 2D display cannot be zero. Why do you want to support width/hght=0 condition?

|As of Errata document it is only for omap 5430 ES1.0. Hence not doing it for ES2.0 or OMAP5432.

|Yes, we keep trying if authentication fails, but when a new start frame cb happens, we cancel the previous waiting work and restart. We cannot just leave it if authentication fails.

This patch is only to clean up the WQ mechanism used, which was very confusing earlier.

|With patch http://review.omapzoom.org/#/c/26779/ condition (d-&gt;num_ovls == 0) is not required as this condition is handled at FB level. When (d-&gt;num_ovls == 0) is removed from here early suspend works. 

I could not test with HDMI as default display with the above mentioned change as it is still not functional on OMAP5 sEVM board.

As mentioned before dsscomp_early_suspend operates with d-&gt;num_ovls = 0 and d-&gt;num_mgrs = 0. If d-&gt;num_ovls = 1 in dsscomp_early_suspend(), it requires a manger id and hence blank cannot happen.
|Minor: No need of brackets here, spurious change
|Why we need this is both hdmi_panel_disable() and hdmi_panel_suspend() which calls hdmi_panel_disable()?
|typo &quot;comming&quot;
|Murali, Sreenidhi, I don't understand your point. This value is updated only in this function and I am protecting it with a mutex when the process updates it. When some other process enters this function, it would read the value and return error. Why do we need to lock the entire function? How can two calls go through if only one process can update the variable at a time and the same variable is verified before doing any operations. Kindly clarify.
|As discussed, this mutex lock is required. The reason is that the HDCP-encrypt daemon would be initiated by any user (it is supposed to be after boot). If mistakenly it is run twice, this ioctl would be called. Hence in order to have protection in kernel side, we need this variable. But this need not be hdcp-&gt;lock. It can be some other lock not part of HDCP driver structure. So I am moving this lock mechanism directly in the ioctl call as Sreenidhi requested and rename the same. But the logic would remain the same.
|Done
|Done
|One blank line between cancelling the work and queuing it. They are logically separate.
|Please look at checkpatch strict option. It recommends if and else to follow same braces/non-braces. Here the if condition has two statements, hence bracket required for &quot;if&quot; and &quot;else&quot;.
|Ditto
|Yes. Not sure, how it compiles! Will correct this.
|Yes. Actually I was trying with the old value from HDCP driver. Forgot to try with 150ms (with a 30ms extra time), which I was planning to. Will check and update this.
|Yes, in case there was a previous workqueue due to interrupt, but by the time work gets scheduled, say HPD is detected (disable &amp; enable). For this kind of scenario, it is required to cancel the previous work, if any. There is no harm in doing it during power_on and it is safe.

|Logically different. Don't delete the extra line here.
|Still we will not be doing dispc clock source switching in dsi_init() as it happens before LCD_EN programming. Atleast dispc clock source switching has to be done in *_post function. Hence only lcd_clk source switching can be done in dsi_init(). But with this approach, the WA handling for CDDS bug OMAP5430-1.0BUG01565  will be completely addressed in dsi_handle_lcd_en_timing_pre() and dsi_handle_lcd_en_timing_post() functions itself.

For non OMAP5 ES1.0, these functions are ignored.
For OMA5ES1.0, when the LCD CLK and DISPC FCLK sources are configured different in board file, the workwround already in place is sufficient.

With this patch, when LCD and DISPC FCLK sources are configured the same in board file, the OMAP5 ES1.0 clock sources selection is as follows:
While enabling DSS:
    -NO clock source switching during dsi_init() and PRCM is the clock source
    -In dsi_handle_lcd_en_timing_pre(), select lcd clock source as per board file configuration and program LCD_EN.
    -Do DSS manager enable
    -In dsi_handle_lcd_en_timing_post(), select dispc clock source as per board file configuration . Now both clock sources are as per board file configuration.
    -Display data

While disabling DSS:
    -NO clock source switching during dsi_init() and the clock source is as per board file configuration and are same.
    -In dsi_handle_lcd_en_timing_pre(), select PRCM as lcd clock source and program LCD_EN.
    -Do DSS manager enable
    -In dsi_handle_lcd_en_timing_post(), select PRCM as dispc clock source. Now both clock sources are at PRCM

Checking DSS_STATUS value is only an extra check as we do LCD_EN programming as soon as select lcd clock source is called.

The idea of adding OCP_USER_MPU is to ensure that the DSS registers access is done through L3 interconnect. If this flag is not defined then only L4 interconnect is used.

Other way to do this is to remove omap44xx_l4_per_hwmod but this need not be done as this file is auto-generated and L4 access is available in the hardware. Hence hwmod database shall still continue to have omap44xx_l4_per_hwmod.

Dan, This patch makes all the the dss driver's register access through L3 interconnect. But in omap44xx_dss_reset(), there is a hard coding of base address which accesses L4 interconnect registers. The patch at
http://review.omapzoom.org/#/c/20138/
fixes the omap44xx_dss_reset() accessing L4 interconnect.

IMO, both the patches are required to address the errata i733.

hdmi_ip_data is used only for HDMI Registers details. The phy value that is being passed is a clock value and is not used across many functions.

Without this patch ION test cases and DSSCOMP UT cases won't pass and would result in bus error mentioned below. This happens when a read is attempted on some ion mapped tiler memory area. This patch fixes the same. No CQ defect available for this.

Sujeet, This was validated by means of adjusting the brightness bar in Android UI using the patch http://review.omapzoom.org/21434. Also this was validated using sysfs commands too. WHile playing video also brightness control has no issues (using sysfs commands) as the commands are sent during blank gap.

|Patch Set 3: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Sreenidhi, the user would have no clue when the display goes dark. User will not be able to find the brightness adjustment bar as the screen becomes dark. Hence I think this patch is required for maintaining the minimum brightness.
|Patch Set 3:

The spec sheet from LG is incomplete and we are already in discussion with them to understand the issue. Will revert this hack once we fix the issue.
|Uploaded patch set 4.
|Patch Set 4: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve


|Patch Set 4:

Praneeth, this hack is required because once we have brightness control from Android UI, setting value of less than 147 would make the screen dark and the user would not be able to see anything on the screen until the user identifies the brightness bar blindly and bring it back to &gt;147 value. Hence this patch is a must until we get this issue resolved.

As of now, LG is yet to come back with reply to our queries. It has been over a week that the thread has started. I don't expect this to be resolved very soon.

If we are going to consider brightness control as a required feature, we need to live with this hack for a little time until we get pointers from LG (we are following it up aggressively).

I did not get any reply regarding the wrong architecture comment. Hence this is still pending. As the comments started on this series, personally I do not want to abandon this, as the same story will repeat in K3.4 too.

Yes, we need to use pr_err_ratelimited only as we need to get the SYNC_LOST msg if it repeats after we recover the previous time. pr_err_once would not help for this kind of scenario.

Sreenidhi, Without this __init we get a sparse warning. Hence this is required.
|Patch Set 1:

Valid question. reason for the warning is omap_hdmi_init() which is called from here is a __init. Hence the error was observed only for this. lcd_init does not have this issue.

Would be good if you can add WA: erratum details in the place where they are handled. Also if this errata is not applicable to non-OMAP4 platforms, use cpu_is_ check

Add errata id as part of comment in the place where the WA is implemented. This is required to track erratas easily. This was my comment in one of the previous versions too.

Will mention in the patch that the WA is not implemented as such as L4 is not used at all. Instead we are avoiding the errata issue itself. Thanks for pointing this out, will be helpful for developers.
|Patch Set 1: (1 inline comment)

Yes Sreenidhi, you are right. We just need to use raw DSI writes instead of enabling DISPC video port in such cases. Well, I will make the comments clear.
|Patch Set 1:

Okay, I sent an email to Sebastian for getting more clarity. Will wait for him to reply.
|Patch Set 1:

Ok will do. Sebastian has mentioned in email that WA is required irrespective of command or video mode. So will implement with these considerations.

No change
|Patch Set 12:

Why specifically binary sysfs attribute?

Please note that this sysfs is used by hwc to read the EDID values. The same sysfs attribute is used in K3.0 and there is big NACK for changing the interface (pls check previous versions of this series). Hence we will not change this.
|Patch Set 12:

Please check &quot;handle_s3d_hotplug&quot; in hardware/ti/omap4xxx/hwc/hwc.c to find out how this is handled. This is not for the user to read sysfs for reading edid values. FYI, when HDMI cable is connected, there is a default print of EDID values with which user can read the EDID values.

As I mentioned before there is no plan to change the sysfs interface for s3d as it affects hwc and K3.0 kernel (OMAP4). We are making use of the same sysfs interface as used in OMAP4.
|Patch Set 12:

Please let us know the reason for why we need to use binary attribute only?

I do not find any other sysfs using binary attribute in DSS. Are there any advantage in binary attribute compared to a string attribute? How is it going to make a difference in S3D handling? Thanks for clarifying.
|Patch Set 12:

A quick try by making it a binary attribute results in HWC crashes. Dumping the contents and verifying the values was fine, but hwc crash has to be debugged. (Thanks to Nikola for testing this during his week long holiday).

Looks like the way HWC reads the EDID has to be accordingly changed? We will experiment these changes separately and send a separate patch for the same. 

As mentioned, if there are any changes in hwc for the same which would affect K3.0, we would not do the changes but we will keep you posted. We can take this forward in email discussion.

Also can you please clarify what is the disadvantage in having human readable attribute for this sysfs (which is working seamlessly in OMAP4 and tested working on OMAP5)? Any specific issues foreseen?

Tony, as you see it is one of the TODO items as mentioned in the patch. We can work on this and send a new patch to address the same next week as this might required some change in K3.0 kernel also. We will be working on this with high priority next week.
|Patch Set 4:

Nikola, I guess the proper approach would be to have same sysfs interface in both k3.4 and k3.0 and code in userpace shall be able to handle both with no knowledge about kernel version.
|Patch Set 4:

Nikola, I agree. We will have same sysfs entry for K3.4 &amp; K3.0 and it would be the same as how we have currently for K3.4 in this series. Therefore, changes are required in K3.0 to adapt to the new sysfs interface.
|Patch Set 4:

Ivan, exactly. that is why changes are required in K3.0 as well along with the hwc changes.

Sreenidhi, this is self explanatory in the patch. num_ovls passed is checked for  greater than and size of ARRAY_SIZE(u.m.ovl) (which is the max no of overlays) and error is returned. Actually it should return error only if it exceeds the size and not if it is equal to the size.

I still feel, if we can find a way for avoiding this 500ms delay, it would be better as we are trying to avoid the error by giving sufficient time to act. But if we can handle the invalid values in user space by checking the state change or something similar, it will be more cleaner. Need to look at how this can be done

|Done
|Should &quot;mHwDev-&gt;mMixer.setPath(mDevices, true)&quot; also be called here?
|Ok, understood.
|Should &quot;mHwDev-&gt;mMixer.setPath(mDevices, false)&quot; also be called here?
|&quot;passing&quot; instead of &quot;pass&quot;
|&quot;registered&quot; instead of &quot;register&quot;
|&quot;writing&quot; instead of &quot;write&quot;
|&quot;registered&quot; instead of &quot;register&quot;
|&quot;extracting&quot; instead of &quot;extract&quot;
|&quot;copying&quot; instead of &quot;copy&quot;
|&quot;copying&quot; instead of &quot;copy&quot;
|&quot;writing&quot; instead of &quot;write&quot;, and &quot;underlying&quot; instead of &quot;undelying&quot;
|Is return value true/false? The prototype shows int.
|The way that the java and native size are written, stop is called multiple times even if the app doesn't explicitly call stop twice. This is because the native finalize will result in stop being called, to make sure it is stopped before releasing the resources. So, it would come as a warning every time, even if the user is following the proper procedure and might be confusing.
|I think this is a similar scenario as what would happen with the original code, if the only supported device for an input was disconnected. In that case, getDeviceForInputSource() would return AUDIO_DEVICE_NONE, and the input would keep the same device, even though it was disconnected. I was trying to keep with similar logic as what was present before.

I can add the warning/error message.
|Yes, that's true, this is redundant. I'll remove this line.
|Good point. We should also check here to make sure the new device is not already in use before updating to the new device. I will make the changes.
|This is checking to see if the input frame size is equal to the number of source channels being merged. You could, for example, have an input frame size of 6 channels, but only be using 4 of those channels to merge to the output. In that case, you wouldn't want to use the &quot;merge_4_mult&quot; path.
|should this be &quot;ti,multichannel-shared&quot;?
|possible typo? maybe &quot;when&quot; is not needed here?
|You are right, it should not do the NOT operation when zoneValue is -1. Default zoneValue should be 0, and then if it is set to -1 (indicating that it is legacy), then zoneValue should be set to the cabin zone. Then the NOT operation can be done. I will fix it.
|I thought that dispatchAudioFocusChange() needed zoneValue to be -1, but checking the AudioManager code, it looks like only zoneFlag needs to be -1. I can make this change.
|Ok, I can add a trace.
|Yes, it's still valid. It was removed from the stack, but the fse entry still exists at this point. It is the same as what is being done in removeFocusStackEntry() above.
|zoneValue is relevant to dispatchAudioFocusChange also, but only if zoneFlag is -1. If zoneValue is -1, then zoneFlag is also -1, meaning that the zone info passed to dispatchAudioFocusChange() is not used, which means it is using &quot;legacy&quot;, or only the main cabin zone.
|This is to reset abandonAudioFocusZone after the removeFocusStackEntry() call, since with this patch, abandonAudioFocusZone is used outside of notifyTopOfAudioFocusStack(). removeFocusStackEntry() now uses abandonAudioFocusZone to decide whether to remove the stack entry or not. And removeFocusStackEntry() is called from more places than just here.
|In exit_voice_call(), audio_route_reset_path() is called. In case of failure in enter_voice_call, should audio_route_reset_path() also be called?
|ret is already 0 here, does it need to be set again? or perhaps ret should be initialized to -1?
|In this case, even if signed_frames is &lt; 0, ret is set to 0. It doesn't look like signed_frames will be less than zero, but ret may not need to be set here.
|With the code as it is, this will never be false.
|minor comment, could use tabs here to match style of rest of file
|whitespace
|whitespace
|whitespace
|Maybe use u8 instead of uint8_t to match with rest of code? Also, should this be in the OMAP_SECURE macro?
|whitespace
|Since peripheral boot isn't supported yet on this branch, do we need these in this patch? If we merge usb boot before this patch then I guess this is OK.
|I think you removed this one, right?
|Should we consider splitting up this patch? For example, we could have one patch that adds signing, another patch that adds the authentication checks, and another that adds the configs for Android and Linux.
|suggest to use tabs to keep style similar to the rest of the file.
|I don't think this is done in this patch.
|use tabs for consistent style
|NAND isn't needed any more. NAND support has been removed.
|Why not use CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT directly?
|Just curious, does this make a difference for HS boot functionality?
|Good catch. I think this should actually be (!obj-&gt;late_attach &#124;&#124; obj-&gt;domain) instead of (!obj-&gt;late_attach &amp;&amp; !obj-&gt;domain). The idea here was to not call the deassert if we are performing late attach before iommu attaching is complete, but that we will call the deassert even if late attach is true after attaching is complete (indicated by the domain no longer being NULL).
|It looks like the code for IPU1 is already in this patch as well. What prevents IPU1 support also?
|Perhaps also mention if this supports single or dual stage boot or both.
|If only IPU2 is supported, then perhaps the IPU1 flags should be removed as well as IPU1-related defines?
|Suggestion to make spacing style consistent, either all spaces, or all tabs, for these defines.
|This doesn't look to have the framework to support late attach with multiple cores simultaneously.
|Is this function used? I think this one is for the hard-coded MMU programming.
|Is this case really &quot;falling back&quot; to u-boot? If IPU is successfully loaded, is u-boot not run? Also, in the case of falcon mode, this would be jumping to the linux kernel, right?
|Perhaps break this into two patches, one that adds the late attach feature, and a second one that adds this to the dra7xx_evm config file.
|should make the indentations with tabs to match the rest of the file
|missing space between &quot;resetting,reloading&quot; --&gt; &quot;resetting, reloading&quot;
|whitespace
|whitespace
|whitespace
|Should this be SYS CLK1 to be in sync with latest kernel code?
|This looks like it is already within and #ifdef for CONFIG_LATE_ATTACH (see line 45). This one isn't needed.
|Minor style comment, rest of file has &quot;{&quot; on next line. Should be the same here, and for other functions that follow.
|needs tabs for consistent coding style throughout this function.
|Will this TODO be handled before the final patch submission?
|Needs tabs instead of spaces in this function and anywhere else in this file where there should be tabs.
|Perhaps a more descriptive error message?
|style suggestion.. add spaces
|here too, and in general, have a consistent style for these throughout the code.
|Remove this function if it is unused.
|Remove this function if it is unused.
|Are these going to remain empty? If so, who is expected to add code here to configure the peripherals?
|Same here.
|Rest of code uses &quot;/**/&quot; comment style.
|Is retVal needed? I only see it set once in here, could just return 0 at the end.
|remove whitespace
|DSP2
|Is this still a TODO? Looks like it is done in dsp_start_core.
|spacing
|Remove whitespace.
|should this print be updated? why does it say &quot;spl_boot_ipu&quot;?
|same here as previous comment
|fix spacing.
|Is it possible to print the remote core name rather than a number here? Might be easier to understand but not required.
|Is there a plan to add QSPI boot support in this patch or is that coming in a later patch?
|fix spacing
|Is it possible to have the ability here to load from a fat file system (like is done here) or from a named eMMC partition (as is done for Android in v2013.04 version of bootloader)? Maybe a config option or something?
|Also supports IPU1, DSP1 and DSP2 now.
|Needs updating to CONFIG_LATE_ATTACH
|Also have DSP_LOAD_ADDR now too
|Is this still used?
|I didn't see this used in the code.
|spacing
|Is this currently supported? EDMA loading while processing the next image? Or is this a possible future enhancement?
|spacing
|This should also have &quot;#if defined(CONFIG_LATE_ATTACH_BOOTIPU1)&quot;
Also, would this be better in a header file?
|This seems to be embedded within the #if defined(CONFIG_LATE_ATTACH_BOOTIPU2). Is this one needed?
|Same here as previous comment.
|Does this exist for IPU1?
|Again, this is within an #ifdef for IPU2
|Is this sequence still needed?
|Is this IPU2-specific?
|Why are there two of these?
|Don't need this blank line.
|same here
|same here
|same here
|same here
|same here
|same here
|same here
|Don't need blank line here.
|whitespace
|same here
|and here
|Please match multi-line comment style with rest of file.
|Please add more patch description.
|Since this is in common code, will this function work for omap5 also?
|True. In upstream u-boot this has been corrected to use dieid 0 and 1 (https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/454086/). The implementation in this patch, however, is done to match what is already in the fastboot and regular (non-ssb) Android boot in the current branch. Perhaps a separate patch could change this in all 3 locations so that it will be in sync?
|Just trying to match non-ssb case, which passes a mach-type when booting the kernel (see line 271 in this file).
|Why add a new config option? Can we reuse SPL_USB_BOOT_SUPPORT, which is what is currently being used for adding peripheral boot support?
|I think the additional 16KB memory usage might be a good thing to note in the commit message also, since it changes the amount of usable CMA pool.
|This is now being defined for both late attach and non-late attach cases, meaning that cmd_elf.o will get compiled in in both cases. Is that needed?
|same comment as dra7xx_evm.h
|If lateattach.c is only compiling when CONFIG_LATE_ATTACH is defined, then this is not true.
|OK, that is interesting. Then probably the sequence in &quot;ARM: DRA7: Add Workaround for DRA7 DSP MFLAG Errata i872
add0afa84900e89595bfe1e6999b42b719031bcb&quot; needs to be fixed to first power on the DSPs and then put them back to power off when done. It was assumed based on the TRM that the DSPs would already be in power ON state.
|From my understanding, the DSP cores would not have been in power OFF state. The the default state at boot is to be in power ON state but with clocks disabled and resets asserted.
|A little more background on what feature this patch is adding would be helpful here. Some more info like what is the feature and an overview of how it is implemented.
|is this used?
|Can this commented line be removed?
|comment style doesn't match rest of file which uses &quot;/*&quot; style for function descriptions
|align with rest of params
|tabs
|Should put mutex protection around this section to protect the callbackmsg[] array for the case where multiple VIDDEC3_create calls happen concurrently.
|Should this pass if outputDataMode is not IVIDEO_NUMROWS?
|tabs
|this could be a warning instead of an error. It is a valid case for the codec not to use row_mode, right?
|May not want to leave your name in the debug traces
|why create the MmRpcCallbackHandle here instead of during VIDDEC3_create?
|I'm not sure I follow the semaphore logic. I see that a sem_post is done here to start the callback. But why is a sem_post done from within the callback after every MmRpc_call?
|putDataFlag is also set to 0 in the callback when a full frame is done. Does it also need to be set here? Is this done for handling the error case, in case process returns before a full frame is decoded?
|should post the sem here to wake the thread to handle the exit request?
|Why do QNX changes require changes in Linux/Android? Is it the SYS/BIOS DSP Radio/APPE application that has an updated sr0 address and now the dts file needs to match?
|OK, can you mention that in the commit message? From this it sounds like the change is to align with QNX, but really it is to align with the SYS/BIOS Radio/APPE application, right?
|In the kernel this is defined as 0x20000000 (IPU virt address for L2 SRAM). See omap_remoteproc.c &quot;OMAP_RPROC_IPU_L2RAM_DEV_ADDR&quot;.
|Ditto above
|Should check for valid rsc-&gt;pa returned and return error if unable to allocate
|Should check for valid pa and return error if unable to allocate.
|Should check for valid pa and return error if unable to allocate.
|spl_load_cores() should be called from here also for QSPI boot
|This type is deprecated in k4.x version of remoteproc. The updated remoteproc.h in the kernel mentions this in the structure. Can this file be updated to match?
|Yes, it is for Y and UV. Good point. In fact, I can probably just pass the one for both Y and UV, since the codec doesn't actually use the buffers, just checks for NULL-ness. I only have to pass a valid value so that dce/rpmsg-rpc can do the proper translation. I will try with using only one buffer.
|When error recovery happens, we need to release all handles to /dev/rpmsg-dce. This is required because all open handles are marked as &quot;stale&quot; by rpmsg-rpc when error recovery is performed. The handles won't be usable again. And until the last handle is released, a new one won't be opened by MmRpc.

Is the concern that we may leak memory with the opening and closing?

If we cannot close this handle cleanly here, then Media needs to be stopped and restarted in order to decode another video after error recovery.
|This was added to keep alignment with Android and also as a placeholder for future use by Linux. I forgot about QNX, thanks for pointing this out. I put it in libdce.h since the rest of these prototypes were in that file. If we don't see any possibility that other OSes may use something similar in the future, then I can keep the changes exclusively for Android and remove this.
|Please align with the rest of the struct
|Please align with the rest of the struct.
|Please align with the rest of the struct.
|Please align with the rest of the struct.
|Update copyright date.
|Could you add a little more detail in the commit message? Maybe mention which address is chosen and what it is used for.
|Does this need to be changed to ALOGE?
|should be aligned with rest of code
|With the change to ioremap the pagetable for all late attach cases, you don't need this check for &quot;late_attach_dma_pool&quot; anymore when unmapping the pagetable. It should be removed so that the memory is unmapped appropriately.
|This definition looks the same as iopgd_page_paddr(). Do we need this?
|Where are these unmapped?
Since we know that in the late attach case, these all exist in contiguous memory, can we leverage that into doing a single ioremap (sometime during initialization) instead of doing this for each entry?
|This definition looks the same as iopte_index(da). Do we need this?
|Yes, that is a good point. Although looking at the OSAL_DeleteTask() code, it never returns OSAL_ErrNotReady, so this code may not be reachable.

I found the following patch in the upstream today, which was added after I found this issue and fixes the same:
&quot;aboot: fix block addressing for don't care chunk type&quot;.
Will submit that patch instead of this one, since it is already in upstream.

Yes, &quot;fastboot oem spi&quot; erases qspi (though not the whole of it; it only erases from 0 to 0x20000, which is the MLO). This &quot;fastboot erase&quot; is to erase specific mmc partitions.

Just some general cosmetic comments for now. Looks like there are some whitespace errors that need cleaning up, I didn't comment on all of them. I guess this is the first patch in a series that would add authentication for dra7xx?

I think we'll probably want a similar change to the dra7xx_evm_android_config also.
|Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1
|Patch Set 4:

I tested the page table dump after late attach and also after error recovery, which results in reloading of the image. In both cases I see the page table info. I do see that the page table is slightly different for loading from u-boot versus loading from kernel, though. Remoteproc seems to be programming smaller sizes whereas u-boot always programs in 1MB sections.

Should we consider also adding a README for the early ipu boot/late attach feature? There are several config flags introduced, it might be good to capture them and their meaning somewhere.

|Patch Set 3:

&gt;&gt;Is there a way to communicate the memory locations used for the pagetables to the kernel instead of creating a new carveout?

Even if we communicated this address, how to allocate that specific physical memory from the kernel at runtime? dma_alloc_coherent allocates from the CMA pool but doesn't let you specify the address AFAIK. If the concern is using more memory, then what if we made each of the remote core CMA pools smaller by the size of the iommu table, and created a new DMA pool for each of the iommu table entries?
|Patch Set 3:

On my previous comment, I meant to say &quot;iommu tables&quot; instead of &quot;iommu table entries&quot;.
|Patch Set 3:

In this patch, all memory allocations for remotecores (except for the IOMMU tables) are from CMA pools.

|Extra blank line ??
|In the case &quot;blaze_uart_info&quot; is not populated, the &quot;module level default&quot; will be used for port initialization. The &quot;module level default&quot; has the the power on reset value for the WER. i.e 0x7f ORed value of these events (RLSI&#124;RHRI&#124;RX&#124;DCDCD&#124;RI&#124;DSR&#124;CTS)

The blaze_uart_info is populated to over ride the module level defaults since we want to limit the number of wakeup events to only 4 events.

So for the folks reporting a problem with this limited setting, can choose to either populate this info structure with the wer setting of their choice or use the module default of 0x7F, in which case not populate blaze_uart_info.

The same holds good for other 3 omap_serial_init_port_pads calls.

|If after 5 retries, the BT chip is still not asleep, you are allowing it to suspend.
Is this acceptable ?. since you are not spinning in code is is a better idea to use &quot;if-then&quot; instead ?
|Agree, the effect is the same if it is while or if.. it is more of coding style comment.
Perhaps the compilers used will optimize to the same either way but a &quot;while()&quot; needs more setup for a typical ISA vs a really simply if-then.

Also, it is not clear how much time is equivalent to 5 retries.  If 5 retries are done in a a fraction of a second, it is no good. The answer to this may lie in the application acceptance which I don't know about and should come directly from the BT application requirement.
|Must initialize retry_suspend to zero, else the first time this is called this is at risk for not functioning as expected.
Change line 123 to
static unsigned short retry_suspend = 0;
|The idea here was to not block till the console is locked.
My understanding of the usleep_range() function call is that if no other even causes a wakeup in the system between 100 and 300 usec, it will time out at 300 usec and check for console lock.
Do you propose something else ?

Thank you
|Please clarify,
I did not notice where in this code the clock status is being mandated.
By clock disabling are you mean coming out of DPLL bypass mode ?

Thank you
|I was only curious and obviously I don't know the code base well at all.
I think with this check if all the uplinks required are found to be enabled by reading the ctrl, the reset path is avoided.
I was curious if there was a path this might be needed like restoring context or something.. ?
|The SCR register usage was recently added even in the case when DMA is not used.

|Djamil,
Looking at at the omap_hwmod.c file, it seems to me that the .off value is not relevent.

the .off value will come into question only when the pad state is _HWMOD_STATE_DISABLED and that state is set only at shutdown.
Also to validate this  I put debug code in this piece of code case 
mux.c 
_HWMOD_STATE_DISABLED:
			/* Use safe mode unless OMAP_DEVICE_PAD_REMUX */
			if (flags &amp; OMAP_DEVICE_PAD_REMUX) {
				if (!strcmp(pad-&gt;name, &quot;usbb1_ulpitll_dir.usbb1_ulpiphy_dir&quot;)) {
					printk(&quot;#RK: MUX: disabled , value written is %x\n&quot;, pad-&gt;off);
				}
				val = pad-&gt;off;
				}

and I never reach this when the device goes into off and out of it.
If you agree we need to ack the patch to make it to merge.
Thanks
Ruchika
|Please see my previous comment
|Why check for just bit 1, From the TRM bit 0 &quot;seems&quot; that is will never get set since values that have bit 0 set are reserved. Designs often have those bits used for corner cases in the design logic. I would prefer it you could just set the whole 2 bit field to 0x2 and then write zero. If there's a specific reason that is avoided please specify.
|1.I like Igor's #define since it follows some naming convention. Why increase the &quot;IN&quot; threshold ?
2.That will not effect your case so might as well leave it to the default of 0x20 ?
Increasing the IN threshold may increase the latency for incoming data (not a use case for audio speakers) but possibly for others.
For other USB devices like mice and keyboards that do IN transfers this value may negatively impact.

3. I fear that 0x40 may not be sufficient for some kind of data streams that still may take more time to decode hence you may still have the same problem but just harder to recreate.
|I don't want to do this since 2 flags vs one will need to be set to enable this path.
|Mykola,
I really appreciate your thorough review. I wouldn't have thought too much about adding another config symbol for another kind of feature but for this errata, I find it more readable to just have the specific ones OR'd together.
|this function grows in the next 2 patches on this subject. I don't see the use of having this inline.
|The next patch has this inlined
|It is inconvenient to have a CONFIG_OMAP4_DIAGCTRL_FRAMEWORK  and an individual errata flag set. I don't see the purpose.
|When the device comes out of off , there is nothing useful in the diagnostic control register, it is zero, I would urge you to try it out also
|Have you tried enabling lines 335-339 ?
It will not work because writing to the register is protected, hence the open source errata will not work and I have to take this routine of setting the bit and using an SMC call.
|That code should stay intact in case someone uses an ARM without the write protection. 
This implementation is OMAP specific hence it will be associated with a different flag 
#ifdef &lt;flag&gt;
|Have you tried enabling lines 335-339 ?
It will not work because writing to the register is protected, hence the open source errata will not work and I have to take this routine of setting the bit and using an SMC call.
|I certainly thought about including OMAP specific files but decided it was best to have changes at a minimum.
If you want to have the .h file included and use symbols etc.. I can include the .h file in this proc-v7 file.. but think there isn't much value. Let me know what you want.
|We would also need to conditionally include the header file based on whether it is OMAP4 and a GP device.
Are there any compile time flags for OMAP4 vs OMAP3/2 that can be used ?
|The intention is really great that if the modem is initialized the USB mode is updated to indicate that the port is not used so that when the ensuing ehci_ohci_init() is called, no stomping over the settings occurs. 
BUT... can we make this cleaner.. 
to start with maybe we can atleast pass in the usbhs data structure as an argument so the person reading code and debuggign knows something might have been changed in that structure when the modem init is done. ?

The implementation is open.. just a suggestion to make this cleaner ?
|This was purposefully removed. Can you elaborate the effect of removing the #ifdef CONFIG_USB_GADGET_MUSB_HDRC in this case ?
|Suggestion:
Change 
:Synopsys USB device controller requires all OUT transfer request
lengths to be a multiple of the max packet size. 

But no big deal. I personally prefer &quot;multiple&quot; for lengths and &quot;alignments&quot; for addresses, but it is personal and the -1 is really for the more optimal code.
|Suggestion:
&lt;variable&gt; = req-&gt;length % bulk_out_maxpacket;
if (&lt;variable&gt;)
{
    req-&gt;length += dev-&gt;bulk_out_maxpacket - &lt;variable&gt;;
}
|I would replace &quot;USB3.0 hubs&quot; to &quot;USB3.0 devices&quot;.
Also repplace the last line with.
We analyzed traffic between a USB2.0 PC host and the USB3.0 device and observed that the host does not send PING packets during enumeration.
Turning off PING packets in the OTG host resolves this issue.
|Suggested code
238                            offset_corr = (device-&gt;bcdUSB &gt;= 0x300)?USB_DT_SS_EP_COMP_S:0;
239                              ep1 = (struct usb_endpoint_descriptor *)bufptr;
240	                            bufptr += USB_DT_ENDPOINT_SIZE + offset_corr;

242	                            bufptr += USB_DT_ENDPOINT_SIZE + offset_corr;

|Is this verified that put_sync actually leaves the phy clocks disabled ?
|I did not understand . The phy was not turned on by twl6030_phy_suspend(..., 0)
it is bad pracice to allow anyone else other than twl6030_phy_suspend to change the state of this &quot;is_phy_suspended&quot; .. it is like a back door entry to the variable.
|Seems like this is the way it is done all over the kernel.

|Why set this when us_dma is 0 ?
|The OMAP4 driver had a variable called &quot;suspended&quot; in the port structure and it gets set when the system wide uart suspend handler... and cleared in the system wide resume handler.
In a dsicussion i learnt that the 2 frameworks are kind of independent of each other .. i.e runtime and system wide suspend.

In omap4 the &quot;pm_runtime_suspended()&quot; check was replaced with a &quot;if &quot;up-&gt;suspended)
So thisi s probably why Grygorii is bringing this up. Looking for an agreement so I can close this. For now .. no new patch on this..
|This was an accident.. this function wasn't getting pulled up as a sumbol with the &quot;static&quot; so just for testing it I removed.
This will be put back
|What about the regular suspend and resume function handlers ?
the original macro sets .thaw /.poweroff etc.. 
those were unsupported too ?
Just curious.
If we don't have support for anything other than suspend* and resume* in that set, I agree, I will remove it.
|I believe it doesn't matter in this file and it is better to not use a macro .. 
This can change per instance..
|No pr_info use. Please use dev_dbg
|Please use #defines for these values 
#define CHARGER_TYPE_MASK 0x7

|I didn't understand this 

Where does this number come from ?Is the CONTROL_ID ?
If so can we read it from the register and return it ?
|Can we make this commit message simpler.. This is rather confusing;

I think a one liner is enough:

The USB-PHY device uses a name &quot;omap4-usb-phy&quot;. This is incorrect.
The same is corrected to &quot;omap-control-usb&quot;.
|It would be much better to use a macro (should be existing) rather than 0x50 and 0x8.
|What is the purpose of above line ?
|These M and N values 1375 and 23 were changed for ES2.0 to 401 and 6.
Any reason why these shouldn't be 401 and 6 resp for a ~1100 Mhz frequency.
I understand that 1375 and 23 yiled a perfect 1100 number vs 1099.8xx but the were changed for es2.0 and m wondering if the same argument will apply for es1..
|From the data manual (below table 2.3) it appears in the MPU_HIGH setting we should set this to

inline message.
Else functionality looks ok as long as the application is ok with suspending after 5 retries. Functionally I am not sure how 5 retries still fixes the problem.

IMO which is of course optional because you all the BT experts, is that as long as the BT chip is awake don't allow suspend. It will eventually go to sleep in a few more seconds from whatever I have observed. I am NACKing because of the unitialized variable and not otherwise. Deciding when to suspend is your decision.. the second part is only my suggestion.

This shouldn't be done. If HS_MAXPORTS is not 4 then this will fail.
The initializing to NULL should be done in the init part of the driver i.e in omap_serial.c 
this will require and EXPORT_SYMBOL which may not be acceptible (need to check).
The best thing would have been for DPLL cascading to take a bunch of registrations for any clock, call all the PRE_RATE notifiers and then lock the new clock and then cal lthe POST_RATE notifiers, so this mess could altogether be avoided.

|Patch Set 4:

The problem I found is this:-
Case 1: Consider just uart port 1. Afteer the device goes into OFF mode the first time, when it resumes, the registers have lost context and they come back as &quot;0xFF&quot;. Then the wer is restored to whatever the wakeup set desired for the port from the board config file info. 
Case 1: For uart port 1, when BT and or gps is enabled, the st_kim driver is also initialized and so is the omap_start done for the port. With the IRQ handler registered etc in the uart_startup function.  The IRQ handles/clears events.

Case 2: For uart port 1, when neither BT and GpS is enabled, st_kim is not even started and not is the uart_startup done for the port. However the wer restored for the port is still set to something functional and there is nothing registered to handle any events/wiggles on the pins, allowing those events to remain set and preventing the port to go into off mode the second time around.

More comments:
Change the subject : reliable and isoch don't mix.
I understand you mean &quot;reliable throughput&quot; and nt &quot;reliable data&quot; yet I would recommend to change the subject to &quot;consistent throughput&quot;

What is the isochronous endpoint size in your audio driver?
Does it have room to increase ?I would exhaust those avaneues before touching this register. If you've already done that please let me know.
|Patch Set 1: No score

Yes,
The subject should change like your previous comment.

About the endpoint size, yes I agree, that size is controlled by the device and not the ECHI driver.

What about using an analyzer to see the packet transfers and how the 0x20 and 0x40 is impacting it..
|Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve


|Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This works but we need a better solution.
|Patch Set 1:

The EHCI specification recommends the threshold to be 1/4 of the total buffer size. 
1/2 the buffer is for each direction of the endpoint. Doubling the threshold will increase the latency for the subsequent fetch of a packet and it likely impact other drivers.
Dynamically changing it might not be good either.
We need to speak with the sgx folks to see what can be done about the priorty for the remainder of the system since this problem is seen mostly in a situation with continuous display rendering.
|Patch Set 1:

I do not know the latency value.
Also, a correction:-
I was sure I read the packet buffer was divided between both the IN and OUT transfers but that is not accurate.
So a threshold of 0x40 with a packet buffer of 0x80 means dual buffering vs quad buffering. I don't know if this is ok for every kind of HS/FS usb device that can be connected. 
 
I don't have numbers for latency, maybe Moiz does. 
By &quot;recommendation&quot; I meant the relationship stated in the IP spec, page 204, manly maintaining the ratio between the buffer size and the threshold.

The buffer size of 1K is not supported on the OMAP, since I tried it and a device failed to even enumerate.

Are you sure you don't have to allocate a buffer for a &quot;zero length packet&quot;, from what I understand of the specs, a zero byte data would still need a packet worht allocated.. 
So when he rem == 0 and the length == 0, you may need to have a buffer allocated.. 
I am putting a &quot;-1&quot; just to ensure we have that covered.. I'll change it right away.. as soon as we are clear on that.
|Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Since it is confirmed that mtp does not have a zero length packet.. the -1 is removed.

|Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Analyzed usb traffic after the patch and it looks great!!
|Patch Set 2:

The &quot;PING protocol&quot; in USB2.0 is meant for control and bulk endpoints. i is basically a design feature to avoid wastage of bandwidth on the USB bus. When the host has OUT data to send, rather than retrying and attempting out data to the device and being NAK'd if the device does not have the &quot;endpoint size&quot; amount of space, the &quot;PING&quot; was added in USB2.0 to allow the host to PING the device to know whether or not to send the following OUT data. The spec states that USB2.0 devices should  support this which we perceive as high speed devices should support this. Apparently they all don't for the &quot;Control endpoint&quot;, so hosts seem to not send the PING to the devices (as confirmed from a PC host traffic capture) to a USB3.0 device. Hence we followed suit and disabled it in the driver also. We don't expect to break andything and all our testing seems ok so far... needless to say alot of testing is always required for any USB source change. But our traffic looks exaclty like traffic from a regular PC host..
|Patch Set 2:

Actually, I was going to send you a message and ask why we hadn't seen this before.. this is apparently somewhat a known issue.

Is it possible that we have bot tested with enough USB devices in Host mode ? (I actually will check if the EHCI sends PING or not and put the status here so we know.)

If you can point to specifics about this and why this is not good, it would be good since I couldn't locate it.. I was surprised to not find mandates on this for a PC host.

I am exploring to see if there is any status reported from the controller to say a &quot;PING timeout occured&quot; to disable further PINGs to such a device. If such a status is not there then is no other solution. If the host fails some kind of certification with this solution, then we have no choice but to put the particular USB device as an &quot;unsupported device&quot; which I expect will raise eyebrows since every PC can support it... we need to do the right thing.. I'll work on my action items and get back.

|Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I understand this to be the following :-

Is the transfer is a multiple of the endpoint size (which can be 8/16/64 etc) then a ZLP packet is needed.
So for USB1.1, the endpoint size(maxpacket) can be say 64 but the transfer is say 256 bytes (count) so :-

((count &amp; (dev-&gt;ep_in-&gt;maxpacket - 1)) == 0) {	
            sendZLP = 1;	
  }

does evaluate to true when this is checked at the END of the transfer BUT if this is checked intermediately intermediate counts of 64/128 etc will also evaluate to true and it may an inappropriate  time for zlp packets.

Maybe I am missing something.. please describe exact issue. I did not get the everything from the commit message and the code changes.
|Patch Set 2:

the &quot;maxpacket&quot; fir an endpoint should be equal to the bMaxPacketSize.

After all the device reports the endpoint size to the host PC.

My understanding is you are trying to make the device work wih a USB1.1 Host controller and the USB1.1 specification limits the endpoint size to be 64. If my understanding is correct please read ahead.
Here are my concerns:
1. When the device descriptor reports &quot;bcdUSB&quot; in the device descriptor to be USB210  does the USB1.1 host even enumerate the device ?

2. With a bMaxPacketSize of 512, does the USB1.1 host still continue to enumerate ?

3. I don' think we should even support using a USB1.1 host.

Please ignore if this understanding is all incorrect and please explain or lets have a short call for this. 

I just have a fundamental issue with he maxpacket not being equal to the bMaxpacketSize.
|Patch Set 2:

I would suggest setting the wMaxPacketSize in these fullspeed descirptors to be 64 and try if this works
mtp_fullspeed_in_desc
mtp_fullspeed_out_desc

So I will remove the &quot;disable_irq&quot; from the suspend handler and the &quot;enable_irq&quot; from the resume handler .. instead populate the resume_noirq pointer.

|Patch Set 3:

Felipe,
This patch does a few things:
1. the request_irq is in the probe.
Don't you thin puting it in startup is suboptimal since every time it starts up the irq is requested vs being already available ?
2. there is a serial_omap_pm function called in the suspend handler which it disables the baud rate clock
3. Removes all he enable_irq and disable_irq. Only one enable_irq is left afer the request of the irq.
If this is not necessary I will remove it.
4  if a free_irq is no necessary in the remove () and automatically taken care of I will fix that.
5. Grygorri mentioned other than suspend_noirq and resume_noirq .. the others are not supported.. I can change that back as well like you have it here and in the patch set previous to this .. but the other changes are necessary.

Please advise.

Felipe,
I hope the commit message is clear.
The request_irq change is necessary to go in this patch.
I traced the code to understand the backtrace and realized te following

When OFF mode is attempted he following sequence occurs
-- serial shutdown -&gt; serial_omap_suspend -- &gt; serial_omap_resume-&gt;serial_omap_startup.

Before hiting serial_omap_resume the backtrace is seen since an enable_irq is attempted on a freed irq.

My  concern is this:
Is it possible this patch s hiding the real issue.
For serial wakeup, I see the wakeup occur since the serial resume is called but the Module for some reason is consistently gets stuck in TRANSITION.
|Patch Set 2: No score

I do not know exactly why, need to check with whoever prepared the base kernel.

I do not see a reset being done in K3.0 either in the serial resume path.
I can see if there is HWMOD flag for &quot;RESET&quot; that does an IP reset.

Are you sure this is needed ?
I believe there was a patch that was merged that removed the unused uarts.

If ONLY the uart instances that are used are initialized, wer can be stuck with 7f or ff in the probe, just like in p-android-omap-3.4 and it will be fine. 
The WER was brought in specifically since there was unused uart instances initialized and they caused a &quot;stuck in transition issue&quot;.

Can you please check if this is needed at all when only uart instances that are used are initialized.

With this setting , RX interrupts will happen at a threshold of &quot;1&quot; word.

I did not find a negative effect of it with the testing I did (i.e audio data) and did not test file transfers and bit comparisons.. so did not see problem. (also OMAP4 K3.0 did not have this setting). 

I'll move that line back since the threshold of more than a byte may not be tolerable.

commit 2fd149645eb46d26130d7070c6de037dddf34880
Author: Govindraj.R &lt;govindraj.raja@ti.com&gt;
Date:   Wed Nov 9 17:41:21 2011 +0530

    ARM: OMAP2+: UART: Remove omap_uart_can_sleep and add pm_qos
    
    Omap_uart_can_sleep function blocks system wide low power state until
    uart is active remove this func and add qos requests to prevent
    MPU from transitioning.
    
    Keep qos request to default value which will allow MPU to transition
    and while uart baud rate is available calculate the latency value
    from the baudrate and use the same to hold constraint while uart clocks
    are enabled, and if uart is auto-idled the constraint is updated with
    default constraint value allowing MPU to transition.
    
    Qos requests are blocking notifier calls so put these requests to
    work queue, also the driver uses irq_safe version of runtime API's
    and callbacks can be called in interrupt disabled context.
    So to avoid warn on slow path warning while using qos update
    API's from runtime callbacks use the qos_work_queue.
    
    During bootup the runtime_resume call backs might not be called and runtime
    callback gets called only after uart is idled by setting the autosuspend
    timeout. So qos_request from runtime resume callback might not activated during
    boot if uart baudrate is calculated during bootup for console uart, so schedule
    the qos_work queue once we calc_latency while configuring the uart port.
    
    Flush and complete any pending qos jobs in work queue while suspending.

It would be good to do the following:
1)
- The subject and message should be nicer.
You have done a nice code improvement it would be good to indicate that rather than only say #defines.

Better to indicate &quot;code improvement somewhere&quot; and in the description add in the things done like 
- Macros added
- Better code

2) Ids pr_info really needed. Can you put pr_debug or something else so it is not by default printed ?If that is a requirement here then add that in the message and ignore this comment.

Felipe,
It seems the dwc-&gt;mode should be in sync with the mode set in hw.
That is the intent.. 
dwc3_set_mdoe is called from debugfs and at that place dwc-&gt; mode is not updated like it is in dwc3_probe(). (maybe forgoten)

Now that I am calling it for the another place as well for the host. I think it is a good idea to always keep the dwc-&gt;mode updated whenever that function is called.

Tero,
The change you are proposing is a much bigger change.
I agree it should happen, but for now I think lets merge this in for Amazon and we will get this change in later.
|Patch Set 6:

Recently, it was deemed that i719 was applicable to all OMAP4/5, hence there isn't a check.
|Patch Set 6:

There is no road map after OMAP5, there isn't a practical need .
Your point is noted.
I will incorporate that later this week.
|Patch Set 6:

errata flags cannot be considered in this patch.. since they belong in the ehci driver related structure.
The next version of this patch will call the sar save or not from within the ehci driver context. That requires some decent amount of code change in the omap-sar.c file and separate sar_ram_layout will be created for usbhs. I have an idea how that needs to be done. This comment will be incorporated in that change.
I notice that in p-linux-omap-3.4. there is no account of OMAP3.
Your review comments are with good intention but I wanted to block out omap3 but there are not even any data structures for omap3 sar, but maybe I missed it ... hence did not bother.
If the next version of the patch works out .. the errata flags will be set and used and your comments addressed.

maybe I miss something but this code looks like this:
So basically an ID interrupt occurs and we keep retrying to check the ID bit being set ?This seems weird.. 

This has the potential to loop infinitely.

Can't we use the &quot;is_connected&quot; flag.
If he host is connected, perhaps this flag can be set and then the code would still sill work well.
Maybe that is a DR for the host to set the &quot;is_connected&quot; bit ?
Doesn't look like there should be a need for another flag.

My question is :
The stack appears to be moved from OCM_RAM at the 0x4030XXXX location to EMIF 1 CS0 SDRAM. This means the EMIF needs to be initialized and ready to go when the stack pointer is set.

Are there any corner cases around this ?

Patch Set 1:
&gt; I understand the good intent of decreasing the code size etc
Ruchika, BSS-section is really intended to decrease code size, but it's not what I've done. BSS section exists always, whether you want it or not -- it's how linker works (check arch/omap5/eboot.lds file). So I didn't provide it. I just cleared it with &quot;0&quot; in this patch. 
[Rk] Yes I understand.
Because it must be zeroed to compliance with ANSI C standard.
[Rk] Is there a requirement to support compilers that are non ANSI C (ISO C)  ?

&gt; but I think this is super backdoor way that IMO can/should be avoided.
Can you please explain, why do you think that clearing of BSS section is backdoor? How can you use it as backdoor?
[Rk] The compiler/linker should be zeroing it out and this should not be done at runtime. This may even increase the boot time to some extent.

|Patch Set 6:

Nishanth,
I see your point that a si unsupported mode should not make it in. But the GL team is working very hard to get the boot time down. ompaboot is just convenient to use to experiment.
If we put EXPERIMENTAL in the commit subject I see it should be ok to put in, given WE/some TIers and GL are the only people using omapboot anyways.

Would you approve ?
|Patch Set 6:

Semen/Nishanth,

What in this patch is violating the silicon ?
It appears OPP_HIGH is an acceptable configuration from the data sheet. I am only trying to understand and shouting is allowed ;-)

If this patch has the risk of causing Silicon melt or something equally catastrophic this should be abandoned .no further debate.This has no chance of a being merged. 

If other sub systems have a problem with this Mode.. is it possible there maybe configurations that don't use those subsystems or the OPP is reconfigured to NOM at a later point post boot before those subsystems come into play/configuration I will still consider possibilities.

Coment to add some pr_info type stuff afer checking various sizes of strings ?/
If makes sense ??
Else no real issues ..
|MPEG4 has multiple roles. h263 encoder seems missing.
|Emilian : I had uploaded a patch (7764) which was setting the zoom to the latest value. It is somehow not merged due to a gerrit error. Can you pull the patch &amp; see if you are still seeing the instabilities?
http://review.omapzoom.org/#change,7764
|Lajos.. What is the difference in the uploaded patch with the previous one?
|OK. And why is the constant kPreferAllocateBufferOnOutputPorts value changed from 3 to 4? Does it have any significance?
|Sorry typo.. it should be kPreferAllocateBufferOnOutputPorts &amp; NOT KPreferThumbnailMode
|Deva...Why is KPreferThumbnailMode &amp; kPreferAllocateBufferOnOutputPorts values being changed? It's NOT protected bu OMA$ macro. Does it NOT affeect OMAP3 functioning? Are you using these changed values anywhere?
|OK. I wanted to know when mLastPreview&quot;SizeUpdate&quot; will be set to false. I did not see the place where it's reset to false. currently you are setting mPreview&quot;Framerate&quot;Update to false.
|Isn't this be 
mLastPreviewSizeUpdate = false?
|These changes are valid for both Audio &amp; video. On resuming we can only check for video decoder before sending the output buffer. That check alone should be enough. I think these conditions are extra check to ensure you don't send buffers which are NOT owned by you. Should be valid for both Audio &amp; video

I think these conditions are extra check to ensire you don't send buffers which are NOT owned by you. Should be valid for both Audio &amp; video
|This is a valid check.

|Have you tried giving a 50msec delay instead? May be a timing issue
|Yes. I understand that. But why is this being removed in the current patch? Is it related to the fix for set format? Was itcausing a functionality break/regression?
|Emilian: Why is mBufSize calculation removed?
|Increasing prev bufs causing frame drops &amp; AV Ts mismatch. Holding this patch till we root-cause  the actual issue.
|Sundar.. I think this checkk was introduced by one of the patches from emilian to fix some zoom issue.

Is this check causing any undesired effect?
|Yes keith. That is the intended final solution. We need to insert the logic in camerahal &amp; test.

This will be removed once it's implemented. This is a WA for the time being.
|I was seeing a weird crash with this. thought valid for omap3.

But yeah.. we can protect it with omap macro untill it's tested there..
|Keith. The -1 is required put the I-Frames at exact 30th position. FOr example if the IFrameinterval is set as 1. The I-Frames is inserted at exactly Frame-Rate position + 1. If we have a frame rate of 30, it will be inserted ar 31st position. By inserting -1, we put the I-Frames at exactly 30th position which is requested by the user.

We have used the same logic in Opencore previously
|Keith. It's upto the user to to choose where he wants to place the I-Frame. We are using -1 as per the suggestion from our codec team.
|Kalpesh.. Pls remove the StopPreview() &amp; StartPreview() from this patch. It's not related to this.

Needs to be root-caused why there is a hang without Stop &amp; Start. We will do more debugging before inserting this.
|Tyler.. Irrespective of when Ducati team provides a fix, we still need this as we cannot base video time stamps on System monotonic timer. This will give irresular spacing of TS.

When ducati team do provide a fix, this fix acts like further protection to other system latencies which might affect AV-Sync.
|Sundar.. This delta is a huge number ranging from 2 to 11 seconds! We've seen that the way ducati is interpolating the system time &amp; the way kernel does is different. We suspect that to be the issue. Ducati team is looking into this parallelly.
|Is mWantsNALFragments condition introduced to distinguish between Software &amp; Ducati codecs? I guess software codec uses this quirk. Can you pls write few comments on this?
|Is mIsEncoder flag not to be checked here again?
I'm worried abt record record use-case. Have you validated video-record use-case with this patch?
|Does Memcpy happen for software codecs?
|Dangling Pointer. CAn you set tmpbuffer to NULL?
|can you make it mrotationupdated?
|What is the memory part he's trying to address?
|Satya.. what is the the scenario described in the above lines? 
what is OOM?
|why do you need the rotationupdated flag when you are already checking for current angle &amp; last angle?
|Ricky.. I agree with you.. But i cannot comment on OMAP3 as i've not tested with this patch on OMAP3 platform. That's whythis patch is provided as OMAP4 specific only. 

If OMAP3 folks find similar issue on their platform, we can remove OMAP4 specific macro &amp; just include OMAP_ENHANCEMENT as you've suggested.
|Dan.. As explained in the description field of the patch, the AV-Sync issue here refers to lip-sync not achieved in recorded video. That is, if we record a video with a person talking, we will observe that the synchronization between Audio &amp; video is not perfect.

Since the issue is related to Android framework &amp; not OMAP specific, it is valid for OMAP3 as well. Keun o. Park from OMAP3 team has verified this patch on Zoom2.

Anyways as suggested by you, I will include couple of lines of comment to make clear about AV-Sync.
|That's rite. I will correct this :)
|I will correct the spelling mistakes.

We are not sure with what configuration Google has tested this code. They may or may not be seeing the issue depending on Audio &amp; Video parameters they are using. like higher Audio sampling rate, Audio buffer sizes, etc.
|Will correct it
|Why is this made false again? Do you expect the function to get called repetitively? In that case this flag shoul;d be set as static.
|1) Remove the CSR ID &amp; insert comments instead

2) The description of the patch says &quot;Skip Zero Size chunks in MP4 parser&quot;. But the actual skipping is happening below under OMAP_ENHANCEMENT macro. This code should be wrapped in OMAP_ENHANCEMENT macro OR the logic to skip the zero size chunks should be un-wrapped with OMAP_ENHANCEMENT. ELse it will cause the paser to enter infinite loop, as described in the below code.
|Does this mean we lock the orientation during record to LAndscape/Portrait always?
|Why can't this logic be handled at the cameraHAL level as it's done in OMAP4?
|Port type not set for h264type.
|The pFrame calculation is common for for MPEG4 &amp; H264. Only B-Frame is not valid for MPEG4
|This is not required. We need to update the nPframes using setconfig. Dont change the target frame rate for B-Frames. Just update the nPFrames according to new frame rate to match iFrameInterval
|Just realized GOLCD doesn't apply for DSI. Can be thought for GODIGITAL
|Srinivas.. Since Pipeline Attr is a shadow register, can 't we delay the GOLCD/GDIGITAL bit untill we set the proper BA0/BA1 on resume? This will avoid accessing of wrong Base address.
|Deva.. Why do we need the configuration of pipelines in save &amp; restore context?

As srinivas saying, these will be reconfigured anyway at resume.
|Why can't we have a condition like Width &gt;= 1080 &#124;&#124; Height &gt;= 1080?
This will be valid for both 1080p portrait &amp; landscape?

Have you verified with Camera Ducati team on what's the threshold above which you need sensor overclocking.

We need to overclock if either width/height crosses that threshold.
|Sathya.. Again my question would be what is the threshold resolution after which you need Overclocking? This needs to be found deterministically.

And any resolution that crosses the threshold needs to have overclocking.

For Example if 720p is the threshold, we need to overclock the sensor for any Resolution greater than 720p. i.ee if If width &gt; 1280 &amp;&amp; Ht &gt; 720. &#124;&#124; if width &gt; 720 &amp;&amp; Ht &gt; 1280 (In case of rotation)

and change the enum values in omapdss.h?
|For NV-12 format, does odd output width work?
|For UYVY &amp; YUV2, won't the width/height be predecimated by pixpg, based on rotation?

Won't this break for YUV2 &amp; UYVY formats.
|Why do we need this line_skip?
|1) The above line is not valid for mem-2-mem mode. Pls put a check.

2)    Also, why only &quot;3&quot;. Is it based on trial &amp; error Or on some emperical formula? What issue you were seeing with the delaycount = 0? Did you try increasing the HFP &amp; VFP to the maximum allowed of the panel value before jumping to this value? My concern is how can we make this generic?
|Truncation happens inside the hardware right? What calculation are you referring to? Without setting this bit, how is the ARGB40 handled by writeback?
|The GO_WB bit is reset by the HW. The correct way is to ONLY write &quot;1&quot; to GO bit &amp; wait for it to reset by the HW. Writing &quot;0&quot; to cancel the update is not in the programming model. ANd i'm not sure if it'll even reset the bit at this stage.

|the dispc_cancel_go_wb() is not the right way to disable. Instead we can just disable the wireback pipeline.

|shouldn't it be goto err2?
|Can you pls find out why this reset was actually introduced? Make sure removing this won't break any other use-case/platform. Can you pls investigate why this reset was introduced.
|Hiding error is not correct. The function hdmi_wait_for_bit_change() is waiting for bit to change to &quot;1&quot;. But you should be waiting for the it to change to &quot;0&quot;.

The condition should rather be:

if (hdmi_wait_for_bit_change(hdmi_pll_base(ip_data), PLLCTRL_PLL_GO, 0, 0, 0) != 1)
|This is a protection if external TE is used. I'm considering all four probability of TE_TIMEOUT &amp; FRAMEDONE_TIMEOUT unlocking the bus.

The issue in hand will get fixed, upon only checking bus status in taal_framedone_cb() function. 

Maybe i need to update the description field stressing this.
|I don't feel this is an workaround. The DSI driver is registering for both TE timeout as well as Framedone Timeout (250msec). Remember timeouts occur ONLY on error scenario.

It should also be noted that for a command mode panel, TE_TIMEOUT will eventually result in FRAMEDONE_TIMEOUT. 

The current code, releases the semaphore for both the timeouts one after the other which is causing the crash.

I'm just stop signalling at framedone timeout and use TE timeout for precise timeout signaling. [TE GPIO]

What needs to be thought is whether FRAMEDONE timeout can occur without TE_TIMEOUT (which is unlikely). This requires the logic to be amanded to use the semaphore count before releasing it.

But this patch is required to fix multiple signaling for the same timeouts (although appear to be different manifestations)
|Anyways i'm contemplating to improve this patch which can handle all the timeouts, without need to remove anything
|the omap_writeback_source does not match with omap_channel enum in omapdss.h. The result would be that the managers for TV &amp; LCD2 would be swapped. This will make WB not work for LCD2 &amp; TV.

|I'm aware of that. My question is, how do you handle the case where the DISPC core clock becomes equal to your pixel clock? In this case how does the scaler work?

Configuring rising edge of pixel clock atleast ensures scaler works for ratio 1:1. If ipc is configured to work on trailing edge, a minimum ratio of 2 should be maintained between DISPC core clock &amp; LCDx_PCLK.

|Can you handle for OMAP_DSS_CHANNEL_DIGIT as well?
|PLs write a note why this is needed (eg.. S3D)
|The comment indicates mem-mem not supported. This patch is intended for mem-mem support. There seems to be a gap, that needs to be addressed.

Why is mem-mem not supported for overlays?
|why are we hard-coding bpp to 4? Concerned about NV12 use-case. If S3D doesn't need NV-12 out, pls write a note about it.

I feel we can stillread bpp &amp; use it instead of hard-code
|There is no question of sync-drop, as we are kicking out all the prior compositions in case of error. This will signal the SGX, &amp; the very purpose why this patch is created. Once the compositions are done, there is no need to return error code, as the error returned will try to call the callback of thay gsync with ECLIPSED_SET DSS state which is anyway not handled by the Design.
|Can we have 2 SAR with same value? Why do we need the duplicate? Isn't this un-specified by the standard?

|This should be else if (pic_order_cnt_type == 1), according to standard
|It seems we are only interested with Vui parameter. Can't we have an offset in SPS, to directly jump to VUI parameter to extract SAR info.

|1) Do we need to append OMAP_TIME_INTERPOLATOR macro hereor it's independent of those changes?

In other words do you see this behaviour even without the patch that you've listed in the description field? It seems the patch you've listed there is protected by INTERPOLATOR macro along with omap enhancement.

2) From the description what i understand is, after we apply this patch, on SEEKING a video, the seek position will be pointing to the next I-Frame of the seek position rather closest I-Frame to the seek position. Is this understanding correct?
|should be OMAPDSS: CEC

|Why do i need to execute this code for a non-S3D use-case?
|OK.. So the best way i suggest would be to either: 

1) Have a dynamic s3denable flag &amp; execute it based on that flag OR
2) Store the codec specific information in a array &amp; use it to determine if it's a s3d video &amp; execute the read.

I'm OK for any of the above approach.
|You mis-understood the question, I don't want the below piece of code to get executed for non-S3D specific use-cases where there is no need to extracting the stream data.

In other words this patch is not valid for non-S3D use-case &amp; you need to design it in such a way that the compatibility exists.

Just because you want to make S3D component a requirement, you cannot execute code which has no meaning for other use-cases.

You can add the S3D flag to protect this or any other better mechanism you think.
|Why is this check not at the beginning of the function?

|I'm not convinced with the statement of the errata. For me it's not making sense how DISPC port can differentiate between DSI modes.
We'll post a question to Arch team on this.
|Well.. I feel this is a typo mistake in errata. Let us confirm this with Fagard Sebastian. DISPC video port cannot differentiate between command or video mode. So this should be valid for both the modes.
|This errata is valid for Video mode also. Remove the command mode condition.

|OK.. It works like this.. Both TUNA &amp; OMAP5 sEVM (LG4591) have the same resolution (720 x 1280). The video editor App picks up the layout files based on the dpi of the panel. 

Now here's the fix: TUNA although has the same resolution as the sEVM panel, the height is bigger than the sEVM. Due to this, the png files created to have the pause, ffw, rwd, play button is very much inline with TUNA panel.

Now since the video editor code is the same for both OMAP5 &amp; TUNA, the video editor is loading the same set of png files even for LG4591, causing the icons to appear bigger &amp; cover the preview area.

What i still don't know is that the icons (play/pause/rwd/ffw) for omap5sevm is getting picked from the mdpi (medium-dpi) whereas it's getting from xhdpi for TUNA. This is NOT the root-cause of the problem though. There are still offsets for OMAP5 that is taken care by this patch.

We cannot hardcode the icon files inside mdpi folder as this is chosen by the system. Now we searched through the net &amp; didn't find satisfying info on what exactly is the condition (apart from panel dpi) that determines icons size.

So we have created the icons on the same lines as google &amp; uploaded for omap5.

Pls let us know if you have a better fix for this?

|I don't agree with this logic. Anyways we can get this done. It's a trivial thing.
|Well There is no use-case based classification. There are only 2 buffers source defined in MetaDataBufferType.h in stagefright:

1) CameraBufferSource
2) GrallocBufferSource.

This header file is from google &amp; we should not touch this file as third party apps built with orig version of header will break.

|Even the original patch did NOT forward the compositions to the DSSCOMP when num_ovls was equal to 0.
if(psDssData-&gt;num_ovls == 0 &#124;&#124; ui32NumMemInfos == 0)
{
                        return false;
}

This patch actually fakes the composition complete to the SGX by calling commandcompelete so that we don't crash. So this patch is actually getting over a crash instead of returning an error condition. This should be clearly indicated in the description field.

Don't you think, this is a HACK &amp; something that should have been handled by the HWC?
|Ya.. i agree.. This is what is missing in description field. I have no objection to content of the patch. But the description doesn't correctly explain what you are trying to do in this patch. 

Whatever given in the description was already handled before this patch &amp; this patch, along with that, does a error recovery by NOT sending the error, and instead faking the composition complete in error scenario so that there's NO SGX crash seen, due to missing compositions.
|Gus.. On OMAP5 we've tried using values ranging from 16666666 to 17544444. The issue is not seen only when physical VSYNC's of the panel made much more than than the referesh value used here in HWC. As of today, we are configuring the panel to get VSYNC's at 62 fps &amp; adjusted the porch values (used by DDK to deduce fps) to get the software value to 57 fps. This is what is used the hwc. With this, we are not seeing any frame drops for 60 fps videos, even when multiple layers are active.

But along with the above, we needed one more patch in AwesomePlayer.cpp to fix the jitter (rendering happening at non-periodic intervals).

We tried experimenting waitforvsync but didn't yield good results. Also we need HWC to be panel aware &amp; not straightforward in case of command mode panels which uses framedone's &amp; not vsync.
|how did you arrive with this number?
|Done. Will add it.
|The if (!mgr-&gt;device) check needs to be done before calling dss_check_settings_apply(...), which use this mgr-&gt;device.

In the above  ifstatemnet we can just include if (mgr-&gt;device-&gt;state != OMAP_DSS_DISPLAY_ACTIVE) condition.

So we can split the above if condition into 2 &amp; put the if (!mgr-&gt;device) at the start &amp; include just the if (mgr-&gt;device-&gt;state != OMAP_DSS_DISPLAY_ACTIVE) above.

|Pls remove static references in the function. It's not good coding practice.
|Pls remove the letter &quot;A&quot; from all the variables declared. This is valid for both AV &amp; Video-only use-cases
|why do we check for 6th bit for printing the variance? I did not get the logic. Is this true for all fps?
|I'm worried about the power numbers here.. If the earliness is more, we might be posting event too often. 

Why can't we have a logic to adapt to the earliness value rather hard-code to 2 msec?
|Hi. Is this applicable to only VIDEO or for even for AUDIO?? Pls not that this code is valid for both Audio &amp; Video and this logic will gets exercised for both.

1) If this is valid for ONLY video, is it because of a CODEC limitation that you are hitting this issue or is it a Android Limitation. If it's a codec limitation, pls let me know what is that, so we can follow up with ducati team. If it's a Android limitation, pls submit this patch to Google as well for review.
|Is there a way when pos becomes less than zero &amp; newfilename stays equal to NULL?

That would cause a crash when setting the TITLE right?
|Agree.. But the WB implementation doesn't do the color mode check explicitly. So had to firewall here.

But i agree with your suggestion. I will modify WB code to have the color mode feature check.

|Hi... YEah i thought about it.. But the CDDS bug never talked about any DSI registers. It just says, RX_FIFO Fullness update takes few OCP cycles. That's why i put this WA.

Conceptually, RX_FIFO Fullness implies RX_FIFO is not empty. MAybe we need to confirm with the HW team about this.

|For android implementation which doesn't really go through the orig apply mechanism, the extra_info is dirtied for every composition, as we update multiple pipes together.
|OK.. since this patch should inherit from p-l-o-3.4, we need to make it HLOS agnostic. I will shift this function out of here, to maintain sanctity of original design.

|Why is this code make generic to both audio &amp; video? When would audio tracks hit this issue?
|Hi.. I wanted to understand why the buffers from ducati are NOT returned back to stagefright upon error? 

Is this a known limittaion with the ducati? I feel we are WA the problem, by skipping the assertion rather finding out why the codec is NOT returning the buffer back on error state. Unless there is a known limitation on the Codec side.

Pls list what is the error state and why is it getting hit in the first place? Can you also list the timing diagram on the interactions between ducati &amp; stagefright when tis issue happens?

On the flipside, why can't you just call flush output buffers on error condition, which returns all the buffers back to stagefright?
|Pls remove the tab.. you can check the font errors by running checkpatch script. FOr example, you have 0001.xx..yy..zz.patch &amp; you want to ensure it is free of font errors.

|Patch Set 3:

Keith : This use-case occurs when we do an AV-Record of 1080p. At the end of AV record, 2 thumbnails are generated(mini thumbnail at the top-right corner &amp; normal thumbnail for playback of video) along with Encoder node creation (H264 OR MPEG4 OR H263)&amp; Camera preview. 

This is a mega memory consuming use-case which requires trading between memory &amp; execution speed. Currently we have bluntly serialized the execution by introducing huge delays (Approx 2secs) between decoder &amp; encoder creations. This has a bad user-experience at the end of record.

This patch, utilizes the NPA mode supported by ducati to optimize memory. We already use this mode in encoders. It's now introduced for decoders as well. This greatly helps reduce the memory &amp; help improve performance of AV-record use-case.

Why  do you need to use KEY_VSTAB for stereo mode, when it's already being used in VIDEO_MODE? Why can't we have a separate KEY for VSTAB stereo?

HAve you taken care what will happen if VIDEO_MODE has already enabled VSTAB &amp; you switch to Image mode &amp; vice-versa?

Have you tested scenarios like recording a video with this patch?

What about the VSTAB option dangling in Image mode?

What about sec sensor VSTAB option in Image mode? Since it's NOT included, will it not create same issues in sec camera VIDEO_Mode?

Pls test the patch by recording a video with secondary sensor enabled?

Can't you consider having a separate mode for stereo &amp; do all your changes there? like STEREO_MODE?

|Patch Set 2:

Pankaj.. I initially tried using the offset between the start time of Audio &amp; video, as you suggested. This offset is updated in track header under 'elst' box of the 3gp parser.

But this offset is only about the start time of Audio &amp; video. It doesn't account for the time where video thread is blocked. It is this time which is causing the audio to record half a second early as compared to video.

After this patch i'm seeing the offset &lt; 100msec. Worst-case i tried recording a 5fps clip, which has an offset of 200 msec.

-1 for tracking
|Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Jean.. I don't have objection to the fix as it's only OMAP3 specific. We (OMAP4) have similar logic handled at the cameraHAL &amp; wanted to know if the same can be done for OMAP3 as well. This will avoid touching of SF code. Just wanted to know that. If the CameraHAL design cannot accomodate this, we can go ahead with the fix.

+1 since it's urgent &amp; need to go into the tree.
|Patch Set 2:

Keith.. In OMAP4 we have the reference count mechanism in CameraHAL which doesn't allow the buffer to be released untill it's returned by both Encoder &amp; Overlay (After display). We have 6 preview buffers in total, of which 3 buffers are passed to both encoder &amp; Overlay. We increment the reference count once it's sent to the encoder &amp; increment it again when sending to overlay.

WHen the buffer gets returned from encoder we decrement the refernce count &amp; wait untill the same buffer is returned from Overlay. Once encoder &amp; overlay return the buffer, the refernce count would have become zero &amp; we release the buffer to OMX Camera for filling. This way we avoid tearing.
All the details can be found in OMXCameraAdapter.cpp file in CameraHal folder. 

It's evident that it's a design level change if it's not implemented previously. That's why i wanted to know if it's been implemented at CameraHAL level or not. 

As far as the fix is concerned i don't have any problem with it since it's protected by OMAP3 macro.

Hi Tyler,

I had similar issues on OMAP4. All the details are provided in the below patch. In our case, Audio used to get recorded 500ms early.

http://review.omapzoom.org/#change,12123

It's a thredaing issue in GB, which seems to have been fixed in HC onwards. 

The above patch was reviewed by OMAP3 folks as well. If you see that Video is ahead of Audio, it's possible that the above patch could be causing issues. Try reverting the patch on your setup.

As far as this fix is concerned, i don't think it's a good idead to tweak the offset time although it's simple &amp; solves the problem :)

Hi,

Pls find the review comments in the code. In general this patch needs to be split into two. 

1) Add Writeback support for Capture Mode
2) Add Writeback support for mem-to-mem mode.

In this patch bits-and-pieces of mem-to-mem code is present, which is causing confusion.

I will validate this patch on 4460 &amp; 4430 mainline &amp; update you guys.

This patch needs lot of cleanup. Pls break this patch into two patches:

Both are independent, and user may want only High profile to be enabled without B-Frames in it.

COmments added in the patch: (I will add more comments after going through the CTTS logic)

Apart from that, the heading of the patch should change to,

Video Encoder: Add support for B-Frames in H.264 Encoder.

Which exactly what this patch does. The enabling of High profile, is already taken care in the other patch.

I understand, ducati enables B-Frames by default, but don't mix that setting in the Frameworks code.

Is this sysfs support for enabling &amp; disabling of S3D feature?? Or it also touches DSS/DISPC registers run-time?

Pls note that, DSSCOMP design does NOT support sysfs. This may cause un-desired behaviour, like compositions getting pre-maturely released by a false sysfs queue.

Pls correct the commit message. Otherwise +1
|Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Jagadeesh:

1) The S3D WB support design is not inline with original DSSCOMP design. For example, you have introduced composition mode for every composition. Did you have a design review with any of video team members before this? [like Lajos/Sunita/Saket]?? This has implication on non-S3D compositions as well. Why do we need to go for this approach, just to show S3D content? I mean did you evaluate any alternate Design approaches before freezing on this design? 

2) From code review, there are DSS specific functions like framedone irq handler, dispc enable functions which are not supposed to be present in DSSCOMP module. 

3) Since these design changes are tightly coupled with HWC changes, we need to have a design review with Graphics team as well. Pls involve Tony L in the HWC design &amp; code review.
|Patch Set 8: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I have concerns on the amount of change this patch is bringing in DSSCOMP in one go. Pls consider following suggestions:

1) Add a new s3d.c file &amp; move all the s3d specific code inside that file. Pls remove low level codes from DSSCOMP &amp; shift it to DSS driver

2) Pls arrange the code in more modular way, breaking the codes into smaller functions &amp; only calling the functions from DSSCOMP with proper comments so that everyone understand what the code actually doing. I tried hard to understand full code, but failed ;)

3) Pls follow the coding standards in the re-work:
Coding Standards:

Kernel:  Kernel Coding Standards
http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle

AFS:  Code Style Guidelines for Contributors

Along with this check, are we ensuring that HDCP work-queue is closed, upon HPD disconnect?

In other words, instead of turning ON DSS clocks for spurious disconnect, isn't it better to close the HDCP workqueue upon disconnect, if it's not done?

Hi.. (-1 for tracking)

1) Can you give the numbers on what is the current Functional clock generated by DSI PLL that is fed to DISPC?? 

2) What is the use-case where DSI PLL generated functional clock is not sufficient for the DISPC, that you have to use PRCM clock?

3) Even if the clock is not sufficient, why can't you increase the functional clock speed from the DSI PLL, by decreasing the dividers? (DSI PLL has two clocks, one fed to DSI PE &amp; the Other to DISPC &amp; both are independent) Why do you need to goto PRCM clock?

4) Have you measured the power numbers on switching to PRCM clock from DSI PLL?
|Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this


|Patch Set 3:

Thanks for clarifying. If the functioanl clock was not enough, how is the current design working for all resolutions?

Is this a customer specific issue? I don't remember seeing this issue while suspend resume.
|Patch Set 3:

Lajos. DSI PLL has two outputs which are independent. One of the output is controlled by the M4 divider, which goes as the DSI functional clock. It's calculated by DPHY/(M4+1).

The other output is controlled by the M5 factor is fed to the DISPC. i.e.. DPHY/(M5+1). 

My question was, if the clock is not enough for driving the HDMI, why can't we increase it in the DSI PLL? WHat is the rational behind moving to PRCM? I don't agree to the theory of DSI PLL to be used ONLY when DSI is on. If that were the case, there wouldn't be having option to choose DISPC functional clock.

I remember that PRCM clcok adds to the power numbers than using the internal PLL. That's why i asked to measure the power numbers when switching to PRCM.

Although i'm ok with the functionality of the patch, i still feel there is a room for optimizations.

As far as your question is concerned, we cannot change the dividers run-time. We have to unlock the PLL &amp; Lack-back with the new values. The factor is determoned by the formula given above. If the current DSI PLL clock is 138 MHz, we can increase it to 148.5 &amp; feed the same to DISPC as well.

Why can't we combine this patch with:

Since both are still in review state? It make sense to have a fix on top if the previous patch is already merged.

Since you have dependent patch still open, why can't we incorporate the fix in the parent patch?

In the defect listed in the description, you have give the below patch as the WA for the issue. But you are asking for these patches to be reverted:

http://review.omapzoom.org/#/c/21421/

1) What happens to the WA patch you have posted (Although you call it &quot;Fix&quot;ing the regression)

2) I remember you had one more patch which was seeking to next I-Frame instead of closest I-Frame, which had a dependency with these patches. What happens to that patch? You are not reverting it?

3) By reverting all these patches, are we NOT hitting the same condition before creating the Patches (Fot whatever reason these patches were created)

4) I feel we should think of fixing the issue rather reverting all these patches. It doesn't make sense to me.

I will let Gabrial/Barry to comment on this, as they know exactly why these patches were created.

Why don't we simulate the HPD call upon recovering from sync-loss? Why do we need to do this &quot;Partial&quot; Enable?

Has that been tried before &amp; found with issues?  For me this is a WA.
|Patch Set 3:

My question was: Why can't we start the HDMI detection mechanism once again on every sync lost? Sync Lost is a serious error &amp; i don't mind 70 msec delay in recovering from that. I feel even the timings needs to be read fresh upon recovering from sync lost.

This is how it's done in LCD as well.

Dan data_lock is the spinlock dedicated to protect the DSS data transitions in the cache.

It was a coding mistake on my part to have included the spin_lock at the beginning of the mgr-&gt;blank() function, without considering the fact that ovs-&gt;disable() also uses the same spinlock inside.

Once ovl_disable() is complete, we should again use the same spin_lock to protect further dss_data transition.

|Patch Set 1:

Archit.. By refresh rate, i mean FPS &amp; not panel refresh rate. Thta's why i'm referring &quot;Frame&quot; refresh rate.

As you said the pixelclock is used by the clients to determine the refresh rate, which is of PRIME importance in Android (Although not set in hwardware which is fixed). In Android we have multiple layers from surface flinger preparing &amp; setting their compositions in separate threads. They don't rely on refresh rate or underlying hardware. They post Asynchronously based on user inputs.

It's this refresh rate which holds all the layers together &amp; ensures we don't post anything more than the refresh rate of the panel (60 Hz). 

That's the reason we were seeing frame drops when multiple layers were active as the refresh rate was set to 64 fps (I don't know why it was set to 64 in the first place!) &amp; for a 60 fps clip, the maximum wait time for layer update was reduced considerably, resulting in frame drop.

The formula used to calculate the RefreshRate is standard (Width + Porch) * (Height + Porch) * Pixel clock.

The pixelclock here is the pico2khz pixel clock &amp; not the Mhz one.
|Patch Set 1:

Archit.. Your calclateion is correct. Just that it needs to e divided by 1000 &amp; consider rounding off factor in two places:

1) SGX where the base fps is calculated
2) HWC where RefreshRate is deduced.

|Patch Set 1:

And strictly speaking we are not taking care of WA here. WA says, the 1 pixel should be transferred through L3 directly to DSI FIFO, not using the DISPC port.

We are just overcoming the condition but ignoring the 1 pixel data. This has to be mentioned in the errata as well
|Patch Set 1: (1 inline comment)

Charu.. Transfer can happen through L3 as well.. So this WA can be implemented. We just need to use raw DSI writes instead of enabling DISPC video port in such cases. 

That's the second part of this errata (actual WA)
|Patch Set 1: (1 inline comment)


|Patch Set 1:

Charu.. I would suggest you implement the actual WA. i.ee use the raw DSI writes for single pixel, along with the current protection

|Patch Set 12:

There has been regressions with using binary attributes according to charulatha's testing.

Why is that you are holding a -1 for this?? The developer has made the choice of using string attribute against binary attribute and is Ack'ed by most of the reviewers.

What is the dis-advantage of using string attribute against binary attribute here (For EDID)?
|Patch Set 12:

My question is: WHat is the functional dis-advantage of using string attribute??

If there were problems how is it working in all OMAP4 products?
|Patch Set 12:

The code is of-coruse reliable &amp; compatible. Why do you say it's not reliable? It's gone to production with many products.

You have still not answered my question, what is the functional dis-advantage of using string attribute in this case (EDID)? Give an example of how this might cause the problem in EDID?? ANd how this case was NOT caught in any of our PT test-cases &amp; customer testing, who use variety of TV's.

Is this code mutually exclusive or c-exist with DSSCOMP early suspend?? in other words have you validated the case when DSSCOMP is used for suspend/resume &amp; we invoke this fb_blank/unblank with HDMI conencted??
|Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)

I understand the &quot;code&quot; c-existed. But when was this code actually exercised?? If i remember correctly, in Android we always use DSSCOMP early suspend &amp; don't use the FB suspend.

I remember Only Motorola used this FB suspend for in one of their project which caused issues with DSSCOMP as both of them were trying to suspend the panel.

Have you verified FB suspend is actually getting called &amp; HDMI &amp; LCD are getting suspended?? And what happens to DSSCOMP early suspend call then??

Have you ensured there are no side-effects of this patch on other Gallery use-cases.

like pause/rw/ffw/play-all. 

In other words have you tested for any regression. I don't want to take this patch in hurry &amp; later introduce more regressions. So pls verify that there are no regressions seen with this patch
|Patch Set 5:

The question is not about opening another DRT to track regression. It's about avoiding it as much as possible. We have to ensure the current patch induces no more regression. I'm stressing this as i've seen regression in Gallery before which led to un-necessary escalations.

All i'm asking is to do more stress testing (like all the gallery options working) with the patch to ensure it doesn't impact any of the existing gallery functionality. I'm not asking to run robustness.

The next_eventUS considers only the earliness &amp; frame rendering case. It doesn't handle case where the frame is late &amp; getting dropped. Consider the case when you post a event for a frame after it gets rendered &amp; the next frame comes late for rendering &amp; gets dropped. What happens to the next_eventUS?

OR consider when we do a seek, which can cause:

1) dropping several frames due to multiple layer synchronization in surface flinger. 

2) Proper sync where the mediatime is updated.

What happens to next_eventUS??

I feel, printing the lateness alone is enough to track the jitter. For printing the lateness time, we can just use two prints, before &amp; after the release &amp; track it logcat -v by using print time option

|The omap_pm_set_min_bus_tput should not be called directly. It should be populated to a pdata ptr and called through it. 

No magic number please.

It is little misleading because ios-&gt;clock is essentially card frequency. 
High speed SD is either 25MHz or 50MHz.
High Speed MMC is 52Mhz or 26MHz.
Standard MMC is 20Mhz.
It seems this works only because you are saving the frequency at which OMAP is driving below. Was this done to avoid setting up the constraints multiple times?
|This does not take care of the scenario where power_saving is not enabled. Going fwd there is always a chance that MMC5 on which WIFI is connected might disable power_saving.
|Setup the default dma_type to SDMA_XFER. Otherwise if this condition fails the dma_type will be zero and PIO is not supported yet.

|Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

1. This patch fails to handle the case where power_saving is disabled. In this case during bootup the constraint would get set in set_ios and will never get released.

2. The changes done to the set_ios function would fail to set the constraint during boot time if 4-bit/8-bit mode is disabled. The effect of this is not seen only because the constraint is again set in omap_hsmmc_enable.

3. The changes made to omap_hsmmc_disable function has a failure case. If the card is removed from the slot the system is left with a constraint.This is because the set_ios drops the frequency and the patch still checks for 24Mhz before releasing the constraint.

The omap_hsmmc_request calls the omap_hsmmc_start_command fn. But for MMC5 the polling_enabled is set to 1 before start_command is called.So irq will be in disabled state because the probe fn disables irq the first time.

It is not enough to just flip the numbers. This change will set the other parameters incorrectly. For e.g MMC1 is removable and MMC2 is non-removable. Also that would mean gpio_cd should not be set to EINVAL for MMC1.

|Patch Set 1:

Replacing msleep with mdelay would increase the boot time.
The change to board file to remove the always_on is coupled with the msleep because this is needed for pbias to ramp up.
Otherwise the change in board file will break SD card detection.

|Patch Set 2:

As msleep is not accurate at 1ms precision replaced it with mdelay.

|All mutex intializations are done before EXIT. 
To destroy mutexes in case of error, (OMX_ErrorNone != eError) check is sufficient. No extra variable (bMutexInit) is required.
|when dlopen() fails it sets some non-zero value as the error message.
so checking (error = dlerror()) != NULL) is not required.

Is this not required ?
|If dlsym() fails, error will be returned from dlsym() fail, not required to check for NULL. If NULL is added then if(eError != OMX_ErrorNone) code block has to be moved inside the NULL check loop

|first component level removal of GOTOs is done.
once all the components are done with removal of &quot;goto EXIT&quot; changes, then macro level removal of EXIT (MALLOC and other macros where EXIT is used) has to be done.

When macro level changes(removing EXIT from macros) are done, then there is a chance that allocated pointer may be NULL if the memory allocation fails. For that reason NULL check is added after all MALLOCs.

Reverting the change in line#612 will run the buffer out of bounds.

Hi Manuel,

Can we add this change also ?
Increment the variables before writing data to pipe in  EmptyThisBuffer() and FillThisBuffer()

pComponentPrivate-&gt;nUnhandledFillThisBuffers++;
pComponentPrivate-&gt;nFillThisBufferCount++;

nRet = write (pComponentPrivate-&gt;dataPipe[1], &amp;pBuffer, sizeof (OMX_BUFFERHEADERTYPE*));
if (nRet == -1) {
    pComponentPrivate-&gt;nUnhandledFillThisBuffers--;
    pComponentPrivate-&gt;nFillThisBufferCount--;
    MP3D_OMX_ERROR_EXIT(eError,OMX_ErrorHardware,&quot;write    failed: OMX_ErrorHardware&quot;);
}

|Patch Set 3: Verified

Added frame mode support for TI AAC component only by checking for component name.

This patch should be integrated once we migrate to SN 3.16, since it has dependency on SN's multi-framemode support. Multi-framemode support for AAC component will be available as part of SN3.16 release.
|Patch Set 3:

Setting framemode for ADTS streams helps error streams 
(ADIF/RAW streams will remain same) to work better. 

When erroneous data is given to Codec, codec is not able to recover from errors as stream mode doesn't guarantee frame boundary and Codec is not recovering from errors leading to playback hang. 

As opencore/stagefright guarantees data to be on frame boundary for ADTS streams, so we are setting framemode for ADTS streams, but each buffer can contain multiple frames (variable in number in Stagefright). 

SN's previous implementation of framemode expects single frame per buffer, but giving only one frame buffer might lead to performance issues. So for this SN has come up with multi-frame mode support. When errors are detected Codec outputs zero pcm, flushes the current buffer and proceeds with next buffer as data is on frame boundary. This way when errors are detected maximum of a buffer data (max. of number of frames in that buffer) can be lost and can decode the other data successfully.

As SN is supporting multi-framemode it is not required to change parser to send single frame per buffer.

I think this works better for all ADTS streams.

Good finding Manual.

May be it is good to have FrameWork to choose between framemode or multi-framemode configuration for OMX.

|This patch is only to move the mpu-&gt;wkupaon  sd return check, inside the &quot;if&quot; condition as it was missing during a merge.

About the error handling in this function, i think it is more clear to exit the function as soon as the first SD fails and return directly the value of clkdm_add_wkdep function without any OR operation, but that would be done in a different patch.

media_profiles is rebased properly.

480p, 720p and 1280p camcorder profiles were removed intentionally because they are not supported by webcams.  Having 480p and 1280p (aspect 16:9) is not harmful but 720p profile is a different case.  Video recorder would try to use it (without consulting with hardware beforehands!) and would crash as this mode is not supported by 4:3 webcams.  In the absence of this profile Recorder would fall back to &quot;high&quot; profile.

On the other hand &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; capture profiles are mandatory and are set to the modes supported by common webcams.

Mike, support for USB video class devices (webcams) is not enabled by default
|The intent seems to be that the clock is enabled in case hdmi is used (but I don't know the history of why it was added in the first place).  This was ported from the p-android-2.6.32 code, and I left it in so as to potentially not break functionality.
|The gpio is (re)configured in case it was changed outside the control of the driver (but very unlikely).  For example the user reconfigures it through sysfs.  This was in the p-android-2.6.32 code, but since it's not expensive to reconfigure a gpio, I left it in.
|Should be 0x0 rather than NULL; omap_uart_state.padconf is a u16 offset, and not a pointer.
|Patch Set 2:

There were too many problems too address in this change.  This change will be abandoned, and replaced with changes 13199 to 13206.
|Patch Set 1:

I have verified that the OMAP3 PER domain goes off without this patch.  McBSP[2..4] are in PER and used for audio on the OMAP3.

The intent seems to be that McBSP clocks are enabled/disabled as needed through omap_mcbsp_request() and omap_mcbsp_free().  The OMAP sound driver does this in omap_mcbsp_dai_startup() and omap_mcbsp_dai_shutdown() when a PCM device is opened/closed.  Since the McBSP suspend callback is missing (added by the patch), the implication is that PER will not enter OFF state if an ALSA PCM device is opened.  This may be the intended effect -- allowing PER to go off by disabling all McBSP clocks on suspend may have unintended consequences if audio is in use.

As this patch affects OMAP4, and PER can enter OFF state (at least on OMAP3) without it, I don't think this patch is necessary.

Hi Francois.  Agreed on the padconf being board specific and does not belong in mux34xx.c.  However, I don't think it belongs in sounds/soc/omap/zoom2.c either.  The convention seems to be that the padconf setup is done in arch/arm/mach-omap2/ or arch/arm/plat-omap/.  I've opted to put the mcbsp mux setup in arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-zoom2-asoc.c.

I retested this change with yesterday's daily build image (DB150) using the OMAP3Camera app.  Video capture (1280x720) worked fine, so the issue with this fix and the 720P Encoder no longer seem to exist.

|Dan, The exact issue is stated below:

DISPC programming happens on the FCLK (LCD_EN bit written in slaveport).
Unsynchronized LCD_EN bit triggers the Timing Generator FSM running on LCD_CLK. Trigger event generation assumes a single cycle behavior considering LCD_EN to be stable.
In OMAP4x the LCD_CLK gating is enabled using the synchronized version of LCD_EN signal which ensures that by the time regStartFSM and regLcdEnPclk receive the LCD_CLK the LCD_EN is stable.
In OMAP5430 ES1.0 the clock gating has an issue and thereby the LCD_CLK is free running.

Already shared the ppt. with you, along with the proposed WA.

|Making a check while calling this function itself. Called only in VIDEO mode. 
In HDMI case, this will never be called, as it is for dsi, hence no check required for that.
|Checked with HW team, it is applicable for 5432 also, hence we can keep the check as it is.
|Both PCD and dsi_fclk will never be zero. This has already been taken care in dispc.
|During wakeup, the value was set to 64Hz due to no specific reason.
We don't support clips with higher fps than 60, hence resetting the value to 60Hz

Dan, Sreenidhi,
It is not possible to put only the required value in the xml file. The system takes entire xml(if present) file from device/ti/omap5sevm and overrides the one from packages/apps folder. 

If we need to change even a single value, we need to put the entire xml file.

Why only for OMAP4 the reset is taken care by HWMOd? Why not for OMAP3 also?

HWMOD framework is common right? Is it that the HWMOD structure is not updated accordingly?

Sujeet,

There are 2 flags you need to check in the dss hwmod data structure &quot;SYSC_HAS_SOFTRESET&quot; and SYSS_HAS_RESET_STATUS

I think it is better to disable the soft reset in hwmod by just commenting out SYSC_HAS_SOFTRESET and SYSS_HAS_RESET_STATUS flags in omap_hwmod_3xxx.c file.
This will avoid the soft reset for OMAp34xx. 
Then add this function for errata fix and call in usb_musb_init function if it is omap3xxx only instaed of calling it in the generic hwmod function file.

|Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This was taken care in the K3.0 kernel using pm_runtime_put_autosuspend which will call the otg_suspend in the omap2430_runtime_suspend function. The charger detection patch is put some extra clock enable/disable in the phy_power function which is creating a problem.

The proper fix should be enable/disable the clocks in the charger_detection function and keep the phy_power as original function. This will solve the hot unplug issue.

Please fix the inline comments
|Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I don't think this has to be fixed this way. Thare is already a function in which it is taken care of cold boot scenario.
You can do the following to fix the cold boot issue.

in omap2430_musb_enable() enable the UTMI mode.
By default it is in ULPI mode so there should not be any issue with charger detection.
|Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Hema/Moiz,

Can you please clearly explain how this patch is helping? the phy_shutdown call is already done before the set_suspend() where phy clocks are cut. Also, logically we are just telling musb that there is a session end by writing to the control reg, how does phy clocks being on or not affect this?

otg_shutdown function will not disable the phy clocks.  
otg_set_suspend(musb-&gt;xceiv, 1) is the one which will disable the phy clocks.
In the current code we are calling otg_set_suspend(musb-&gt;xceiv, 1) which is disabling the clocks before the SESSION END bit in the control module is set which would miss the disconnect interrupt of MUSB.

The flow should be as below:
1. in the disconnect(VBUS_NONE) event handler there is runtime auto suspend function called. 
2. Otg_set_suspend function is called to diable the phy clocks before changing the interface select to UTMI 2. call otg_set_suspend function to enable the phy clock back.
3. otg_shutdown is called to set the SESSIONEND bit of control module which will enable the musb to generate the DISCONNECT interrupt.
4. after the timeout the pm_runtime_put_sync will be called to disable the musb and disable the usb phy clocks and shutdown the phy.

With this sequence every thing should work fine without any issues. Please let me know if you need more clarifications.

|The C_states defined arei n 1P configuration where CPU1 is OFF. So CPU0 will be in WFI and MPU INA.

As already said by Mike in the case of 2P, CPUx WFI will be hit in omap4_enter_idle function
|Yes when we are in SMP no power management. The 2 CPUs can only do WFI.
This is the case currently in the code even without this patch.
|The C_states thresholds are calculated based on our measurements done on L24.11 kernel and estimations done by architecture team.
THese thresholds values are not optimized as our latencies are not optimized yet.
For this reason, what we need is that to have the C-states implemented on Android. Then a New pass of measurements will be done in order to refine these thresholds on Android products.

All the latencies are very high: if we just take the ramp up/down of vdd_mpu it is set to 1.8ms currently so just by optimizing this value we'll reduce the latency of ~1.5 ms... more optimization should also be done in order to reduce these latencies.

What I propose is to implement these C-states, we can reduce thresholds if you want in order to be able to enter them. New measurements will be done on Android and we'll fine tune these values.
|For IVA the prescal should be equal to 1 and the ramp should be equal to B so the register value should be 0x010B010B and not 0x001B001B. The code should be:
voltage_write_reg(OMAP4_PRM_VOLTSETUP_IVA_RET_SLEEP_OFFSET,
(0x1 &lt;&lt; OMAP4430_RAMP_DOWN_PRESCAL_SHIFT) &#124;
(0x1 &lt;&lt; OMAP4430_RAMP_UP_PRESCAL_SHIFT) &#124;

(0xB &lt;&lt; OMAP4430_RAMP_UP_COUNT_SHIFT));

Maybe for this reason you need the hacks to make it work on OMAP5
|Why using pwrdm_post_transition it should be pwrdm_pre_transition?

We already clear the prev powerst in the functions pre/post so no need to call the clear function before the pre/post anymore
|Why not calling the pwrdm_pre_transition function for the core_pd as well?
|please fix the comment /* replace by */ to avoid warnings during build
|Please move it to just after the call of the function omap_enter_low_power() to be coherent with what has been done on CORE
|we need to cut the clocks of the thermal even when CORE is going into INA.
|move the spin lock to cover the entire code, just before the wake_low =
|move the spin unlock to cover the entire code, to the end of the function
|I would prefer if you move it inside _omap5_gpio_apply_wa 
call it at the end when the gpio-&gt;bank.id==7
|I would prefer that you move it inside _omap5_gpio_remove_wa call it at the beginning when the gpio-&gt;bank.id ==0

in this way it is inside the WA function, it is cleaner

We need to implement the different C-states in order to be able to do our real measurments for fine-tuning the thresholds
|Patch Set 1:

Regaring the C1 threshold which is 150 us, I porpose to put it to a low value as well as the latencies in order to enter C1 in the use cases where estimated idle time &lt;150us.
If idle time &lt;93 us we'll not hit the targeted power state and if not we'll get a gain.

It was the case on OMAP3630 and this is what has been done

I did a mistake in my previous computation. in fact HSCLL should be =0xB instead of 7 and HSCLL=0 for HS mode. this gives 2MHz as a HS speed. 
Please if you can correct the settings.

Jonathan,
Once we are in idle (the idle task is executed), this_cpu_load will return 0. Once you have activities, it will return values &gt; 0 which correspond to a weight of each process running and waiting in the queue

It should not be submitted, it is just a hack. it will not work in all use cases.

|Patch Set 1: Fails

I think that we should set the right fifo thresholds in the functions default_get_overlay_fifo_thresholds () in the file display.c as well as in the function dsi_get_overlay_fifo_thresholdds in the file dsi.c
|Patch Set 1:

I applied the patch and didn't see any chnage or improvement in the DSS MSTDBY assertion time.
I kept the patch and applied my hack where I set the fifo_high to fifo_size and fifo_low to fifo_size/2 and here I can see that the MSDTBY is asserted correctly.
From this experience I deduce that the patch is not overwriting the thresholds values set by the function dsi_get_overlay_fifo_thresholds.

FOr this reason I think that the change should be done  in the function dsi_get_overlay_fifo_thresholds as well. its values are not overwritten

Thanks

Nishant,
I do not think it is because of IVA_AUTORET. The answers I had is that they were trying to cut it but they had an issue with CDC REQ3 which is controlled by the GPIO enabling USB ULPI PHY
|Patch Set 3: No score; No score

they have to update the exit latency according to their corresponding SYSCLK setup time if they gate the SYSCLK in C3 and C4.

I think we should solve the issue in other way.
we need to maintain the valid bit as it permit to disable the C_state since the boot.
to solve the issue we should not use explicitly the numbers 1,2, 3 in the function _fill_cstate_usage, we should use an incremental variable

Remember that the C-states repartition may change when we are going to do the study of the C_states. they are not the final C_states.
But wanted to keep this C-state with CPUs OFF as an invalid one  especially for the people who are working on the coupled c-states and on the issue of FOrced-off.
it could be good to keep this C_state that supports the COUPLED CPU IDLE flag as the code of the coupled CPUidle is already there.

|Patch Set 2:

the MPU next power state is set at the beginning of the idle path in the function omap5_enter_idle
	if (atomic_read(&amp;cx-&gt;mpu_state_vote) == num_online_cpus()) {
		omap_set_pwrdm_state(mpu_pd, cx-&gt;mpu_state);
		omap_set_pwrdm_state(core_pd, cx-&gt;core_state);
	}

In the function omap_dec_mpu_core_pwrdm_usecount to disable SR you check the next power state of the MPU so the targeted power state that you have set in omap5_enter_idle as shown above. It is independent of the CPU states.

For the MPU to hit (in HW) the targeted power state you need to have your CPUs hitting the targeted power state.

But you disable you SR based on what you have programmed your MPU next power state( the targeted power state), you can never know from your SW if the MPU is really going to hit (HW level) the targeted power state.

So it should be fine with this patch, I have also put a trace in omap_sr_disable and it is being called

In hdmi.c, the request_irq() function should keep &amp;hdmi as the argument.  Instead, the free_irq() function should be changed (argument &amp;hdmi instead of 0) to match.  Otherwise, there is a dependency on omapdss.def_disp=hdmi in the bootargs, and we get a kernel panic if we don't set HDMI as the default display.

I believe that there is still a dependency issue with USB_ANDROID in this patch.  With the default configuration, USB peripheral works OK.
