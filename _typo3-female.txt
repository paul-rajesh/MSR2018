== Dumping data for table JOINED_TABLE

|this example is misleading, title is stored in sys_file_metadata
|nope, error again, sorry. The default value resides in sys_file_metadata and can be overlaid on a per use base in sys_file_reference. Sorry to be picky.
|ROFL ROFL LOL WTF?
|I would like to keep the old name. This is a public function, by renaming you introduce a breaking change.
|agreed, prease keep it straight.
|sorry, mistake, this is just as it was. Don't change it here.
|no, not unrelated :) Used for static wrapper functions
|I need it to mock the is_file call. Can be done shorter, though, thats true.
|protected
|$subject please, $fixture is a helper construct, but not the system under test.
|sure about that one $url{0} ?

http://fr2.php.net/substr first example says $url[0].
|again $href[0]
http://fr2.php.net/substr first example
|why was this changed? Sorry if I am wrong with the {} vs. [], only marking the occurences so they are not lost in case they need to be changed again.
|again [] vs {}
|again [] vs {}
|again [] vs {}
|line 956 and 960 are exactly the same, is this on purpose?
|typo =&gt; will be merged
|use or introduce a getter for the GLOBAL?
|no, / in the first place would make no sense whatsoever.
|cut off? Something missing?
|needs to be named Last Template Name (see TemplateView.php)
|this must be the last part in path string
imagine call &lt;f:render layout=&quot;Emails/Newsletter/default&quot; /&gt;
-&gt; the default needs to get checked, not the forders
|Format is correct. The file extension for the used file is determined from the desired format of the output.
|this will count each existing record, not taking deleted or hidden ones into account.
|this is used nowhere. The input parameter is no reference.
|Use GeneralUtility::isFirstPartOfStr() here, that is the task it was created for.
|make this a class property loaded only once?
|it does not ensure the AND in the beginning, this is only a reminder how it must be created.

$this-&gt;mconf['additionalWhere'] is the string verison of the TS config, which is used, if there is no stdwrap version, which would come with $this-&gt;mconf['additionalWhere.'].

The warning issue is valid.
|please use &lt;f:uri.typolink ...
|this is the output of the link VH
|same here
|additionalAttributes is only used for ATagParams
|the uri has no ATagParams
|something is wrong here. The file gets not removed on click, without the patch it works.
|don't change labels, because translators are not aware of such changes, so it is most probably only changed in default language. Introduce a new label, if needed.
|I don't understand the usecase. Why should you call on a array_merge function and expect a string to come back???
|why was the LF removed here?
|This class IS
|with an extension (remove the s)
|ignorevalidation is correct
|please keep the hint 'Icon path must be relative to the typo3/ directory'
|You are free to decide, preference is usage of use keyword. IDEs do this on their own.
|use the ::class notation
|do we still keep the deprecated setting? It is removed in all other places
|same here
|namespace declaration must be very first line after &lt;?php
|this is a pair of brackets too much.
|$messageDetail can be added once in the end of the switch, after it is always the same.
|moved to function addAdditionalIdentityPropertiesIfNeeded() according the backport of a bugfix done in Flow. https://forge.typo3.org/projects/package-typo3-fluid/repository/revisions/b074081871f2e302ef30f83b9216c7cc28c6a724
|has resolved itself, there is no 'no rewritten property mapper' anymore
|removal intended?
|how about return TRUE; and adjust the docheader?
|same here
|this would be return ''; (empty string)
|[TASK] please
|use the short class name here, you imported it already with use
|TRUE, FALSE and NULL are never lowercased.
|was the only one around, so I tend to drop it, too. It is bad style anyway.
|typehint array here for the first parameter, default values for the others? Docheader says, second param has a default of '&amp;nbsp;', but this is only set after the signal is emitted. Same for the third param.
|no, it is back in PS 8.

|don't run in BE :D. The module is broken.
|no. Lets not introduce more hassle in stable branches.
|I don't think so, either. Isset should be fine.
|Done
|I don't want to do something else than moving stuff here. For the removal we can file another issue. You fine with that?
|this removal should not be part of the patch.
|okay, someone moved it before. so fine with me.
|this must not be here anymore.
|I saw it. But it makes no sense to add a type, if this condition can never be reaches due to the missing fields, true? Functionality is like expected.
|it starts on line 23 in both overrides
|Done
|absolutely. $TCA is discouraged, and in this case not even complete.
|typo: require(d)
|can we use the namespaced class name here please.
|why this early return here and in the branch above? Looks unnessessary.
|what is the purpose of commented functions?
|instead of throwing and immediatly catching the exception, create the syslog entry here?
|use the ClassNameUtility here
|don't remove the chaining
|don't remove the chaining
|typo prevented
|exactly, still needed. Leave the deprecation message as is, too. This message deprecates the old class name AND this file.
|are those lines not needed anymore? Looks not like part of the hook.
|typo here Hanlder -&gt; Handler
|True, I was mistaken by the available TCA configuration. This one replaces those.
|Done
|Done
|Done
|Done
|Done
|This is already done by the Unittest Bootstrap.
|I would prefer the local variable then. Will you push an update?
|It is an object, no array.
|the [] must not be here, right?
|mea culpa, I did not see the test above that one. So forget about all my comments.
|this test seems to apply even after the change. Code says 'give me the GET/POST parameter id' and if there is actually one, it should be returned.
|Granted, but for the sake of demonstration, what the method is supposed to do, I would like to keep this one. So you cover both cases, id set and not set.
|last place - behaviour has changed to stay compatible with Flow.
|I use the formating rules provided by the TYPO3 codesniffer, so it should not do any harm.
|there never was a deprecated log function call, because this is done only if you call to the deprecated functions setTemplateRootPath() and its kin. Not needed here.

The combination of old and new behaviour has been removed on purpose after discussion with Bastian Waidelich. It is clearer this way to solve the paths without any overlay magic. Besides this is the way Flow Fluid solves the issue and we can stay in line.
|this part is here twice
|typo Enumration -&gt; Enumeration
|too -o please
|don't remove! Functionality needs to be kept for two versions.
|don't remove! Functionality needs to be kept for two versions.
|don't remove! Functionality needs to be kept for two versions.
|= FALSE
|don't remove! Functionality needs to be kept for two versions, so are the tests.
|'is of type unknown type' sounds a little bit weird, I propose to remove the first type or emphasize the phrase 'unknown type' somehow.
Same in DirectoryNode
|function comment is missing
|include databasename into message
|Prepare
|typo: representing
|better use intval()
|I like to avoid the even more intrusive usage of a class variable.
With the missing annotation I am with you and will push an update.
|the parameter is not needed anymore with the getter in Place
|remove it here as well please
|you may simply use @inject annotation at the property, dedicated inject Methods are not needed anymore.
|since TYPO3 version 6.0 is installed per default. Check might be good anyway.
|remove the parameter as well as the if construct. It is not needed. In case you use predefined values (check- or radio boxes) in your model, create an instance by using $objectManager-&gt;get(). create() is deprecated.
|rewrittenPropertyMapper does not pass invalid objects back to referal action anymore, only valid once come in as a parameter. Is this respected here?
|remove space
|typo?  @validate vs.  -validate?
|don't use makeInstance() in extbase context. Let the objectManager do the work (only $this-&gt;objectManager-&gt;get(....);)
|return $this-&gt;disable; is enough
|will you switch to FAL at some point?
|you will not need this. getFirst() does the job just fine.
|count after limit(1) makes no sense IMHO. You are in trouble when nothing is found as well a more than one.
|I mean remove the limit statement and test the result to be 0, 1 or more then 1.
|deleted should be no property, thats part of QuerySettings. Find details at http://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3v4-mvc/wiki/Default_Orderings_and_Query_Settings_in_Repository
|no, I hint to
// add deleted rows to the result
$querySettings-&gt;setIncludeDeleted(TRUE);
or FALSE in your case. But that is default anyway, so you can simply remove the statement.
|true, my bad.
|chaining is possible here
|usage of require_once will result in FATAL. Trust the autoloader. Simply remove this statement.
|with TYPO3 version 6.1 the TCA handling went through an expensive refactoring and improvement. Find it here: https://review.typo3.org/#/c/18452/
|remove space &amp;$GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']
by the way, no reference needed here, that is a singleton :)
|same here, remove the &amp;
|thats a lot of code duplication around here. refactoring possible?
|since TYPO3 version 6,1 there is a BooleanValidator shipped with Extbase, see https://review.typo3.org/#/c/18512/
|can you use the NotEmptyValidator? Does the same.
|remember to implement ValidatorInterface in all your Validators since TYPO3 6.1. It is required, Validators without it are ignored by the Resolver.
|uppercase filename is important for case sensitive operating systems.
|I prefer to respect the coding guidelines.
|hardcoded labels?
|have in mind that TYPO3 version 6.0 is already old stable!
|... except for the ones in doc comments. IDEs do not handle this well.
|move this part towards the actual execution as discussed.
|$possibleViewName = str_replace('@vendor', $vendorName, $this-&gt;viewObjectNamePattern);
|rename the variable to result.
|still a typo, sorry for nitpick. It is subgroups.
|Please use the Copyright Notice as defined for Extbase Files:
http://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3v4-mvc/wiki/Copyright_Note
|not used in Extbase
|double Backslashes
|remove mention of Flow
|not here, right?
|What do you mean with 'graceful in other cases'? How else give a useful message to the developer?
|we are not done with the decition!
|still namespace
|what do this variables do?
|namespaced please
|typo: updateRelationInRelationTable

type mismatch: $sortingPosition = 0
|what max value?
|intention if comments is dropped.
|typo 'Defaul_t_'
|the typoscript parameter is named the same. easier to handle if consistent.
|it is unified, are you looking at an old patchset?
|no assignment inside of conditions, please single out
|else is missing here
|consider usage of objectManager

|we do not have any contexts :(
|makeInstance? objectManager-&gt;get()?
|old property mapper will stay until 6.2. So we have to diskriminate here between old or new property mapper used.
|full qualified? \TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Core\Bootstrap
|no namespaces in 4.7, true?
|the correct versions are 1.3, 1.4, 4.7, 6.0, 6.1
|this will slow down everything.
|remove the comment, too
|remove the comment, too
|why not integrating the line in the existing condition?
|delete this line, it will cause trouble
|must this test run twice?
|no typo, I did this on purpose to make sure the tablename returned is all lowercase.
|the headline is too long, can you shorten it somewhat?
|two times possible
|um - what? Please rephrase, that is not readable.
|not tag, but attribute
|if (!empty($foundIdentifiers))
|okay, I agree.
|object
|may -&gt; must. This is imperative, no option.
|In tests it is always possible to _set() the object in AccessibleMock. We use @inject throughout the core, so it should be okay to use it here, too.
|this is inside an foreach, that fills $lazyObjectMap. So it is empty only on first run.
|remove the $_, after it is not used.
|typo =&gt; implementation
|:D
|maybe use GU::intExplode and third parameter to prevent empty values?
|look at line 182 for the proper type naming please
|here, too, see line 187
|this will not work. $uid can be an array!
|please use full qualified namespace, when you use the class only once. If it is used more often, use statement is fine, but then call the other places with short name  as well.
|visibility change is not neccessary, see other comment upon usage.
|use $translationConfigurationProvider-&gt;getSystemLanguages($pageId); and get back $return[0]['title'];
|only create this wrapper getter functions in the class, which uses it (yes, even if that means code duplication). This is only an intermediate step to dependency injection and must clearly show the dependencies of the class.
|comma is missing, too
|is blobDefault not needed here?
|missing 'will'
|use the function pageIsNotLockedForEditors?
|use the function pageIsNotLockedForEditors here, too?
|put the real namespace in here? Or loose the line.
|still the label id is missing, as well as the color
|loose the 'be'. will replace is enough.
|one is singular (icon), one is plural (sizes). Please adjust.
|implement
|means (the next lines, too)
|can change
|makes
|logDeprecatedFunction() ?
|there is a letter missing, but I am not completely sure which one: 'will no*t* be used' or 'will no*w* be used'.
|you sure you wanted to remove this?
|Done
|Done
|Done
|Done
|Done
|-based
|well, no. The sentence makes sense, sorry. Stays as is.
|-have been removed
|as shortcut
|With this ``BackendUtility::getUrlToken`` is not needed anymore and therefor has been marked as deprecated.
|attribute
|because this part throws deprecation warnings as well. The properties have been marked as deprecated, so they should not be used anymore.
|the not is not needed here, true? Without _not_ providing ...
|a simple assign would be suffient here.
|I guess you may remove that now?
|don't think so. needle is always a string, so are all the entries in notSetableFields.
|what is this line good for?
|it is no avatar, it is the image field. No fixed usage for that field. And the 6 was there before.
|true. Will do.
|done during document scan.
|see above
|it is. See method before. This is the fallback.
|not needed
|class name is way too long
|why full qualified names?
|id only is sufficient, class may go. Install.js needs adaption.
|this is a temporary solution
|line has probably copied from the DeletedRestriction? Should feature the correct field to be evaluated (ctrl/enabledcolumns/endtime).
|ctrl/enablecolumns/fe_group
|ctrl/versioningWS
|two times means
|ctrl/enablecolumns/disabled
|ctrl/enablecolumns/starttime
|neither DeletedRestriction nor TCA lookup for fieldname here. Is this intended?
|Done
|no licence header for Fixture files
|please remove this empty line
|please find out the exception code of this exception and use it for explicit test
|please find out the exception code for explicit testing, the wording of the message might change over time, code never.
Please do this for all occurences.
|that is the case, the namespace does not even exist anymore in the core. We made that together, looking up the actual used class and put it to use.
|forget about that, table sys_language has no deleted control field defined.
|deletedRestriction is missing here.
|I would suggest to removeAll()-&gt;addDeletedRestriction()-&gt;addBackendWorkspaceRestriction() [pseudocode]
|same here
|Done
|I guess a DeletedRestriction is missing here.
|please use a restriction here, not the deleteClause
|still missing expected code. All occurences in this file.
|Done
|there is no default yet, the first entry is taken. I define a default here, and I choose this particular one because it is the one people mention first place. Completely biased decision from my side.
|nope, not yet. This would crash the concern of the patch. But the idea is good, I will take care of that in a separate patch.
|Done
|Yes, it initialzes the (not given) parameters to the class.
|no
|yes, see removed render argument
|it is gone already. Check the current master code.
|Done
|currently no other way to prevent the call to LocalizationUtility. This is an intermediate state, will be gone with https://review.typo3.org/#/c/49289/
|Done
|why not using doctrine API?
|the key $hash is unused
|again, you touched some other patch during yours. This should not be part of your patch.
|here, too, unrelated changes.
|table !== 'pages_language_overlay'
|type safe comparison, please (===)
|$tableName = $table === 'pages_language_overlay' ? 'pages': $table;
|$table === 'pages' &amp;&amp; ...
|$table !== 'pages' &#124;&#124; $table !== 'pages_languages_overlay'
|same here
|and here, too
|well, that seems not to be enough of an description ;)
|superflous space
|what is that?
|remove from patch
|remove from patch
|superflous space ' pages_language_overlay'
|here, too
|here, too
|here, too :)
|table is pages_language_overlay, no condition needed.
|now the check for $table == 'pages' is missing completely
|superflous space
|the usage of $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['ctrl']['transOrigPointerTable'] needs to be removed all over the core, in order to remove the setting itself.
The condition for pages is correct, but the TCA request needs to go.
|never ever remove code by commenting it. If it is not needed, delete it.

This is very easy to solve: if ($table == 'pages') {return 'pages_language_overlay';} return $table.

You may even deprecate that function. Once the foreign translation table concept is gone, it is not needed anymore.
|same here, remove $GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['ctrl']['transOrigPointerTable'].
|same here, transForeignTable is the opposite setting to transOrigPointerTable and its usages need to be removed.
|same ...
|here is the gremlin, you changed the wrong line.
|make this a count query?
|I would prefer a warning or info. Silently ignoring the fact of 'wrong' default charset removes the option for the user to inquire his hoster for change.
|Done
|I would prefer to have the storing action and the return action in two lines. Took me some seconds to understand that this line does both. For the sake of readability, please?
|sure about the constants usage here? Wasn't there anything about no deprecation for constants and therefor better avoid that?
|return type definition is missing
|comma missing 'Multiple conditions must have boolean operator &quot;OR&quot; or &quot;AND&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;' . $logicalO
perator . '&quot; given.'
|comma missing again as last char in this line (but inside the quotes)
|this backslash looks like it doesn't belong.
|was this meant to be a 'force' again, like used earlier?
|probably. There is a acceptance.suite.yml next to it, that should move then, too.
|that is still not ideal, because it relies on a prepared json payload. Would be cool to use a generic request object here, too.
|avoid return in process flow. Set $relations to empty array an let go, foreach will take care of the rest by doing nothing.
Leave line 256ff. intact then.
|yes, we can't tell what the cookieDomain is. So it is not granted the base path will end up in cookiePath. Same above.
|because it is used twice in the class. If you prefer two GU::makeInstance calls, I am fine with that, too.
|true enough, mea culpa. Will rework.
|I am not so sure this action is necessary at all?
|Lets keep it for a while, there is more to come and I will clean up the templates once all is ready.
|I left the debug here for your convinience. Look what extension the test load or not load.

works nicely, but after this is a Feature, please add a documentation file to sysext:core/Documentation/Changelog/master. You find examples there.

I added some unit tests for the proposed input types of object collections. Please note the test for SplObjectStorage, that is marked as skipped.
There is no way to get access of individual items with offsetGet(), like proposed in this change. This will fail, because offsetGet expects an object, not an integer type!

I suggest to remove SplObject from the possibilities and stick with ObjectStorage, array and QueryResult. If no one objects or improves, I will do that on sunday evening.

@Olly: I value your involvement, but would you mind, instead of freely commenting and voting -1, to push updates for the changes you propose? This would in fact be helpful, instead of killing motivation.
Sorry when this goes over harsh, but really, finding your votes everywhere does not improve motivation. Thanks anyway, your notices are valid.
|Patch Set 14:

thank you. Why don't you join us on Slack? We could work together instead isolated. It's more effective, and fun, too.

I prefer the b/w compatibility without a potential fatal error due to usage of not available functions. Please properly deprecate those and let them write to the deprecation log. So updating instances are not left with a white page, but maybe missing functionality. That's way better than a fatal, even if the called functions don't provide any useful functionality anymore.

This is a feature and will not be backported.
|Patch Set 4: Verified-1

hm, as far as I can read, this patch does not connect with the requested feature anymore (configurable via TypoScript) and ignores Ernestos Remarks (fix it in the typolink function).
Might be it creates a valid absolute URL for menu entries, but the description does not reflect this.
Additionally, if this is a Feature or a breaking change, a documentation file is missing.
|Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1

I opt for abandoning this patch, because there is no gain in fixing a broken approach. This whole flexform/switchableControllerAction stuff needs to rethought and receive a proper concept.

Hi Stefan, please have a look at the last two tests I added for StandaloneViewTest, they show pretty well what the order is.
The trick is first to call ArrayUtility::sortArrayWithIntegerKeys() and then array_reverse(). This is done in the ActionController as well. So the highest key (for numerical indizes) or the lase item in the array (for strings or mixed array indizes) is access first.

I am sorry about the bad news, but we found out meanwhile, that the @after annotated function is only executed in the test class it belongs to. So no global implementation is possible at this point.
Please abandon this patch, as it does not work out as expected. Thank you for all the effort.

Each class must provide their dependencies, so getters for GLOBALS must not reside in the Abstract class, but in the class, even if this means duplicated code.

this change is unnessessary. You can do a
$repo-&gt;add(object) what initiates the insert. Then $persistenceManager-&gt;persistAll() launches the real insert (or any other databased/persistence related) action. After this, $object-&gt;getPid() contains the pid. You have to ask the repo anyway, when you want to do more stuff with the object after insertion, so this will not help you.

hi, sorry for the late reply:
Currently there is a limitation of Slack being &quot;invite only&quot;, but this is only a technical limitation. If you work with or for TYPO3, consider joining it by asking for an access to admin@typo3.org. Give them your e-mail address, forge user account name and wait for your account to be created.

Then join http://typo3.slack.com/ and our channel #typo3-cms.

I can't see a change in behaviour. It is still a counting of records, only moved from PHP to database level. Can you please explain, what has changed in terms of behaviour?

okay, got the changed behaviour. So TASK might be fine, but the change is good.

I don't like the coupling of the install and the reports extension. Changing visibility of protected functions, therefor adding it to public API, is no option IMO.

Hi David, thank you for your engagement to improve TYPO3. Sadly you try to fix a version, that is in extended maintenance mode and thus only receives security relevant patches.
If your issue still exists in master and 6.2, push your patch to master. When it gets approved, it can be backported to 6.2, but not to 4.5.
I now abandon this patch due to this policy.

Xavier told, moving language files (and even remove labels while doing so) is fine. I would like to have a confirmation, though.
|Patch Set 2: Code-Review-2

after clarification by Xavier we CAN NOT move language files without breaking translation for older versions. I will adapt the patch accordingly

textwise fine, thanks for all the work put into it.
I am not much familiar with JS, so please take no offense in case my proposal is stupid. We introduced a compatility extension, where we put all the stuff we remove from the core, in order to prolong update time for users. It is compatibility6 in typo3/sysext. Might it be an option to put the removed JS functions there?
compatibility6 will be deprecated from the start and released to TER after removal is complete.

the limit was once raised by #59391. I had never problems with 250, too, and I remember discussions back then, why the raise should be neccessary.
In case we keep the 400 as max. value, the decrase of LogLevel to warning might be fine. Just my 2 cents.

I introduced a hirarchy of LogLevel, smaller than 250 raises an error, smaller than 400 a warning. Can we all life with that?

I am all in for using the if-VH, reversing the condition and be done. This are five lines of code we reuse, I think this is bearable in comparison to the gains:
- shorthand syntax
- then and else possible

consider this use case:
&lt;f:for each=&quot;{entries} as=&quot;entry&quot; iteration=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;{f:unless (condition:foo.isLast, then: 'list_entry', else:'list_entry_last)}&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/f:for&gt;

I removed all the files from the commit, that not actually decraese in size. Additionally I fixed the file permissions back to standard, which were changed with the original patchset.
Now some functional tests fail due to the files changed. I will fix this with a follow up patch.
|Patch Set 5:

in a Unix System, you can create a file, that is included in your path like this:
cat ~/bin/git-file-size-diff 
#!/bin/sh
. git-sh-setup
args=$(git rev-parse --sq &quot;$@&quot;)
eval &quot;git diff-tree -r $args&quot; &#124; {
  total=0
  while read A B C D M P
  do
    case $M in
      M) bytes=$(( $(git cat-file -s $D) - $(git cat-file -s $C) )) ;;
      A) bytes=$(git cat-file -s $D) ;;
      D) bytes=-$(git cat-file -s $C) ;;
      *)
        echo &gt;&amp;2 warning: unhandled mode $M in \&quot;$A $B $C $D $M $P\&quot;
        continue
        ;;
    esac
    total=$(( $total + $bytes ))
    printf '%d\t%s\n' $bytes &quot;$P&quot;
  done
  echo total $total
}

Then apply the patch in an early patchset and run in the git root
git file-size-diff &lt;commithash&gt;. The output will show lots of files with a differenz of zero or positive numbers. Those grow larger compared to HEAD~1. When you apply the latest patchset, only negative numbers are displayed. Those files are smaller now.

In extbase context, setTemplatePathAndFilename is no public API. You are to configure this via TypoScript, but not in the controller.
The only use case, where you set the template on your own, is for Fluid Standalone View.

hey guys, I value your constant effort to clean up code, but would you mind to be a little bit more selective with your wording?

the form configuration of your form, the typoscript of your overridden layout and maybe some thoughts, how you developed the solution provided here, to get me in the right direction.

Additionally this means (probably) a breaking change to existing form configurations, and this is something that we need to avoid.

|Patch Set 1:

my ExtJS window listing dependency violations and the warning is only 176px wide, so this looks quite strange, but this is the only thing I really found (Chromium Browser on Ubuntu Linux on not full screen mode).
I tested:
- download an extension with offending dependencies from TER (offending itself and dependencies with offending version dependency, too)
- upload a zip extension with offending dependencies, dependencies needed to be downloaded from TER with offending version dependency.
- upload zip extension, with dependencies available in the system.

@Jost: thanks for finding this issue. Mind to provide a patch, that moves the felogin TCA manipulation into TCA/Overrides? This might not be the last extension causing trouble by using TCA manipulation in ext_tables.php

The Thumbnails Option is not available, when no images are in the default importExportFolder, even no upload function.
After an image is available, there is no noOption in the selectbox for the thumb, so you have no chance to choose no thumb.

|Uploaded patch set 10.
|Patch Set 10:

so, here we go. The implementation should now be in line with Flow Fluid. For details see the comments section in the forge issue.

@Alexander thanks for the function moving and the test, I took this and improved it further.
Code Duplication has reduced to a amount where code stays understandable.
|Uploaded patch set 11.
|Patch Set 12:

@Phillip thanks for the fix :)

@Alex I talked to Bastian Waidelich, who made the patch for Flow Fluid, and we agreed upon a less magical, but better to read approach for both systems. For those who looked at the code, the overlaying and merging might be fine, but we need to keep the 'usual integrator' in mind, so this is better. Thanks for your feedback and (hopefully) the test and your vote ;)

Hi Alexander, I am really grateful for all your enthusiasm about this patch, but would you mind to leave the authorship to me when you push new patchsets? It is not very polite to just change it to yours.
Besides, I would prefer you let me do the changes. Comment on it, as you did before. There are more people in the process then only you and me, we communicate via messenger and email.

Thanks a lot for understanding (I hope)
Anja

Tests are green and installing packages works. No code review though, because I don't really get whats going on here ;)
|Patch Set 16: Verified-1

Result when I try to install felogin: 
Oops, an error occurred!

The package &quot;about&quot; depends on &quot;050_coretypo3_srctypo3sysextcore&quot; which is not present in the system.

There are directory seperators missing maybe?
|Patch Set 16:

Found this:
typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Package/PackageManager.php-&gt;buildDependencyGraphForPackages
line 606  if (!in_array($dependentPackageKey, $packageKeys)) {
$dependentPackageKey is 050_coretypo3_srctypo3sysextcore, but $packageKeys is an array containing 0 =&gt; 'core', 1 =&gt; 'about' ... etc.

is this helpful?
|Patch Set 16:

In case this information might help, my folder structure is this:

050_core/typo3_src/typo3/sysext/core
|Patch Set 16:

@Markus: absolutely positive on current master, Cache was cleared on file level, and this key is not cached somewhere, but a concatination of all folders prior to the sysext

@Helmut:
drwxrws--- fileadmin
lrwxrwxrwx index.php -&gt; typo3_src/index.php
lrwxrwxrwx typo3 -&gt; typo3_src/typo3
drwxrws--- typo3conf
lrwxrwxrwx typo3_src -&gt; typo3conf/ext/050_core/typo3_src
drwxrws--- typo3temp
drwxrws--- uploads

In typo3conf/ext/050_core/typo3_src is again a symlink pointing to current master.
|Patch Set 16: Verified+1

After some investigation I remove my vote here. The problem is not the patch, but it is a basic issue. I open a seperate bug report for this. 
The issue is related to my folder structure, where the Core is situated inside typo3conf/ext. For 'normal' setups the patch works as expected.

there is still some discussion ongoing on forge, lets wait for the outcome. Btw, there is IMHO just no sense in escaping XML with htmlspecialchars().
|Patch Set 1:

I am inclined to abandon this patch due to inactivity. The proposed change here is senseless, it needs a more expensive approach to properly escape xml output. (see forge)

I wonder if it would make sense to rename the setting to disableCascadingDelete. This would match the other settings available.

it is right this way. if you want the raw result, language overlay must not be taken into account, no matter what the respectLanguage setting tells.
I try to add a test.

The patch does not solve the problem and after some discussion internally gets therefor abandoned. We will come back to the problem.

The reverted patch introduces a regression. We have no easy fix for it, so the patch gets reverted. Sorry for now, we come back to the problem.

This test was never meant to test a language overlay. So this patch fixes the fatal and is therefor good to merge. Additionally we need tests for language overlay.

the recursive validation has been backported frem Flow directly, so this patchset is not needed anymore.

|Patch Set 3: Fails

I found some (hopefully minor) problems:

* Reports Module can't be accessed due to endless loop
* in About Modules icons are missing

and what tab descriptions were you talking about? 
This is a great change, I will happily review again.

lets not wait for anybody, but get this in or out. After reading the description in the rst file, I consider this change breaking for instances using the content fallback setting?
If so, please mark the patch accordingly, and refine the rst file. It misses the Impact part, and personally I find it somewhat short. Please provide some examples how to use the new feature in whole, and show what the benefit is. Thanks

I think we should handle each item in a seperate patch. First goal should be to not bloat the existing one and get it in, when it is considered useful. After no one spoke up to deny the patch for not making sense, I opt for finishing it, merging and go from there for the other items. Agree?

hello here, is someone still interested in this patch and the feature? Looks like something worth working on?
As it is a feature, it can only go to master, which is version 7 now.
The proposed solution is incomplete, so more effort needs to be invested.
Please show some hint, otherwise I will abandon this patch in three weeks from now for lack of activity in order to keep the review queue useful.

okay, this is too much hassle right now to fix properly. Before something happens here:
- the change breaks tests (PHP Fatal Error)

Markus, the file deny pattern must apply to admin users as well, so this patch is a valid bugfix. When an admin is able to upload an executable file - you can imagine where this leads?

            20 = Partials
            20.wrap = fileadmin/templatetest2/&#124;
        }

this is not possible (and considered overkill):

layoutRootPaths {
			10 = fileadmin/templatetest/Layouts
			20 = TEXT
			20 {
				wrap = fileadmin/templatetest2/&#124;
				value = Layouts
			}
		}

the extbasefluid book is not part of the official documentation and not relevant in terms of intended behaviour.
Outside the extbase context all newly inserted records are by default in default language (sys_language_uid = 0), except the configuration of the backend says differently.
Extbase must copy this behaviour and not introducing some stuff again on its own. Namely the default setting of languages = all (-1) for newly introduced objects is no issue IMO. So the current behaviour, ending in setting the _languageUid to 0, if not explicitly set otherwise, is the correct behaviour.

I think the @packages lines in the fixture classes can be left out. Otherwise fine, tests run green. Thanks for the cleanup.

first the patch to master, which is then backported. Saves double work.
Please abandon this one, because the master patch will be backported (if so decided) with the same Change-Id, what makes it easier to find.

Marc, usually we don't patch patches, just add your improvements to the patch.
So I suggest to abandon this patch (I spoiled it anyway with my rebase) and you add your improvement to the original patch at https://review.typo3.org/#/c/41612.

Hello Xiaoling, thank you for your contribution. Sadly, like Andreas already pointed out, your patch is invalid in terms of intended behaviour. Therefor I abandon this patch now. Please don't feel offended, your engagement is appreciated anyway. Please join our reallive messaging tool Slack (https://forger.typo3.org/slack) in order to avoid work in vain like it happened now.

Hi Albrecht, thank you for your patch. Please note, that all patches need to go to master first. When it is clean enough to go in, it will be merged and then the backport to other branches can take place. Please push your patch to master, I block this one for now, until the master patch is merged.

This WIP presents the idea of a smooth migration on steroids feature shipped with the install tool.
After upgrading to a new core version, a test can be initiated to crawl through all the extension files and look for code affected by code changes. The description for each case is given by the documentation .rst files the core ships.

Current proposed workflow is as follows:
- Upon calling the tool, all available rst files are listed and link to the online documentation.
- Upon hitting the 'scan' button, the code analysis starts against the code base.
- All matches are displayed in a list.
- Tags, both extracted from the rst files and applied dynamically, make for easy filtering of interesting places.

In a later step, code migration will be added to actually change the affected code.

More later, this is a very early WIP :)

@Frank: during moving files around, I saw there is a part in install.css prefixed with 'not needed', and in install.less a tagsort.css is included. Might be this is only a shortcomming of my system, because I have no grunt build chain set up. Would you be so kind and check that in the end, so we ship no double styling code? Thanks a lot.

Testclass was refactored to use real instance, and in this process I discovered a bug in value transformation. That lead to the changed sequence of is_numeric.
Additionally, in order to make the system under test callable, I extracted the unit processing into an own class. This leads now to the possibility to insert own units. Maybe it is more of a feature now? Not sure, please give opinions.

Mathias, without that change the confirmation feature of ext:form is broken completely. Having confirmation enabled and using the configuration, too, will lead to no confirmation at all.

The impact should be low, though, as the confirmation configuration possiblity has never been documented.

the patch as is introduces the same debug informations to all backend views, as long as the setting is enabled in the admin panel.
Binding the option to the development context is not to my liking. If someone has access to the admin panel, he should be able to perform the debugging action, no matter what context the instance is in.

Frank and Claus are informed and will take up the topic again.
|Patch Set 4: Published edit on patch set 3.
|Patch Set 4:

not sure yet. If enabled, the JS functionality is broken. That might be considered okay, as when the debug output is enabled, one probably doesn't wishes to browse the site.
But a problem remains: after activating the checkbox in Admin Panel and pressing update, nothing happens. Browser reload doesn't either. One has to clear the frontend cache in BE and then reload the page in order to see the output. Same applies to disable the setting. What to do about that? Can the FE cache be cleared automatically?

Tested the little monster in a normal editorial way, like probably be done during setup of a new page. The Wizard feels handy, even if I could name some UX improvements. Those can be handled later, as well as some issues I experienced with the frontend side of things. This is no blocker for having the main patch merged rather sooner than later.
Thank you guys for all the work you put into this highly welcome and appreciated improvement.

sorry Andi, you are mistaken, the approach is not breaking. The both CTypes can happily live next to each other on the same page. Only the old wizard is extracted and not usable anymore. But this will not break any existing forms.

|Patch Set 2:

here is the story:

I want to provide test extensions globally to be included into all functional tests the core provides, in order to test for side effects. This is true for all kind of hook or signal using extensions. If the guard clause is not strict enough, all kind of funny stuff might happen in scenarios the extension author did not think about (think workspaces).

Additionally, some functional tests, like in the dataHandler area, might want to run independed of any extensions. So the test author can provide an exclusive setup without global extensions. Still it is possible to provide an extending test class for that exclusive test class, that again allows for the inclusion. I demonstrate that with the ActionWithSideEffectDetectionTest.php.

For this to work, the extension author needs to provide an own Bootstrap file, that fills into the new function (see FunctionalTestsBootstrap.php). Then either a new FunctionalTests.xml or a dedicated call to phpunit with that alternative bootstrap is required. But thats all for extra work.

Please don't hesitate to ask me about all this, because I really want this addition to be part of the core. It will only happen in 9, but I use it already in a system, so each bit of improvement, that ensures the eventual merge, is very much welcome.

Please also refer to https://review.typo3.org/#/c/51957/, which is a requirement for this patch.

|Wouldn't it be better to return an array with the original file name instead of having a new return value?
|Not sure but I would say there aren't any wrong caches afterwards.
|Shouldn't that be a label?
|please add another - after eval
|see above
|can we add !empty() just in case $res['value'] isn't set
|Parent record is fetched before overlay in the next line!
|Any reason for removing this?
|double space and wrong class name
|Is this change wanted?
|Wrong constant
|wrong constant
|missing use statement?!
|Wrong class
|This syntax can not be backported to 6.2. Should we use the good old array()?
|Do we need some wakeup function than to restore the objects?
|Maybe could just save the uid and restore object on wake up?
|After dealing with __sleep function are we sure we have to return array keys here? IMHO this is a numeric array then?!
|Never mind, I found it out by myself
|Removing the unset doesn't help to prevent the closure. Unset added in new patch set.
|we have only one field per table defined
|It even serializes on its own. Thanks for the hint
|This is old code, please don't force to change! Not even sure if we know what this has to meant
|The fetched record row is passed to FlexFormTools
|As this is the default mode it should be mentioned at first
|Wrong example
|isn't a good example
|Not mentioned in the rst file
|Should this be saved in own class attribute for performance reasons?
|Maybe use strtolower for comparission to prevent errors?
|should be hsc'd
|should be hsc'd
|@Michael: Sorry, this was the answer for @Sascha ;-)
|I think this would overwrite a deactivated clip board then.
|This should be refactored in a single function returning the button. I think makes any further changes more easy than.
|Done. But which type can be a string other than a string?
|IMHO the expected slash is missing
|I would prefer to show list elements with font-size: normal
|This was removed with patch 90cd2f4
|This isn't triggered at all
|selectedElementWidth is only available if element is NOT collapsed
|This doesn't help much as the RTE is within a hidden IRRE element and therefore hasn't any width.
|This helps preventing the loop but for IRRE elements the width is never set.
|See above - width isn't available here for hidden IRRE elements.
|Do we still need that line? I think width is set by the eventlistener now
|has to be uppercase
|Why don't you use $this-&gt;storageMock
|see above
|As mentioned I would prefer this icon is always visible by default.
|Improves readability of message
|Set in typo3/sysext/backend/Classes/Form/Element/GroupElement.php 261
|Shouldn't we use a count here to improve SQL?
|Agree for not calling enabledfields but maybe we need deleted=0 here. Will check this!
|But this is a public function. You'll never know what information you get and IMHO we should be save here?!
|And there is some cleanup done to meet GCL
|Any reason to dissolve BACK_PATH but not tplRow?
|isn't used anymore
|isn't used anymore
|as $e is unset before we should either use isset() or !empty()
|see above
|see above
|see above
|Is it necessary to log it? I would prefer &quot;userFunc&quot; than &quot;USER&quot;
|Please don't use tt elements as this isn't a standard element http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/tt
Maybe replace with &lt;em&gt;
|'&lt;strong&gt;userFunc: &lt;/strong&gt;'
|Empty line above please
|Please add at least the class for which this testcase was created
|IMHO this isn't need as you have your own mock in functions
|I prefer autoload more than require the class file!
|Even TSFE is affected and so hooks might break as well 

$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['tslib/index_ts.php']['preprocessRequest']
|empty() should just check if the array key exists, not checking the value!
|I think if (!empty($this-&gt;modSharedTSconfig['properties']['colPos_list'])) is a bit fast than is_array
|Shouldn't this be initiated anywhere?

GraphicalMenu should be mentioned as reserved key for $additionalJavaScript
|As this is a public feature, shouldn't we deprecate it and add a fallback to additionalJavaScript
|by reading the code this seems not working. $this-&gt;colPosList isn't set in the if part but overwrites the $this-&gt;activeColPosList
So why we have the if part than?
|do we need that line or could we simply combine both arrays anyway?
|Just because of reading the code. Does this mean, I have either submit all database connection data or I can use the LocalConfiguration?! Shouldn't we use the configuration as default and overwrite submitted data?
|Any reasons why phpdoc comment was removed completely?
|If you use !empty you don't need any isset before.
 elseif (!empty($extbaseFrameworkConfiguration['view']['templateRootPaths']) &amp;&amp; is_array($extbaseFrameworkConfiguration['view']['templateRootPaths'] &amp;&amp; method_exists($view, 'setTemplateRootPaths')) 
should be sufficient
|see above
|see above
|Please remove as the __construct function is declared above
|As the slot function expects a reference this causes an error on execution. See https://review.typo3.org/#/c/31063/ for patch
|If you have a look at $importExportUtility-&gt;importT3DFile it should be an array!
|See one sentence before -&gt; coreapi
|If we have public functions for file xtracting the extensions shouldn't take care about the remove of the backup folder. The destructor is the most save way.
|Was my thought than as well
|Funny you criticize old code. This was only moved to the new function...
|In fact I have no clue, as it isn't documented in the different functions either.
|I decided to move this to an own function
|I thought we do not add that anymore?!
|See above
|Superfluous backslash
|Any reason?
|I haven't changed any function names so feel free to change them :-) IMHO the function should be independent from any core usage so I think it is better to force a start and end date. It's just the way we use it in the core. And if you see the core functions you get a better idea of what's happening in the function. If you just assign an end date you have to jump in the source code to become an idea how the start date is resolved.
|Go for it.
|Yes, this is an (unwanted) typing error
|Do we need to push it into the typo3-cms channel? Can't we set up an own one so people can choose to sign in/leave on there own without loosig other actions/information?
|As $inData['meta']['thumbnail'] is not set the LocalDriver tries to get fileInformation from a folder
@see LocalDriver::getFileInfoByIdentifier ($fileIdentifier is empty)
@see LocalDriver::getMimeTypeOfFile ($absoluteFilePath = root directory)
|As my first defined storage is a read only non-LocalDriver storage it has no temporary folder defined and therefore NULL is returned. Because FALSE !== NULL there isn't any exit and getStorage() is called on NULL afterwards
|I think a single return would be less readable!
|This is an ajax action which doesn't need to return anything at it triggers a page reload. But we do not need to start any fluid rendering.
|Sure. You can return json to the request. But here isn't any return needed, so the empty string is enough.
|Why?
|&quot;required extensions&quot; than
|Is this done elsewhere in the core?
|The thrown exceptions can be either php, typo3 related or extension related, which means in general that the (required) extension will be missing afterwards.
|Does it? I haven't heard of it.
|It is an partial and turned to json in the template. HTML is need for proper styling within the confirm box.
|It is a string
|Own tearDown isn't needed at all, as the unset is done with a reflection in parent class. Removed it.
|Not needed anymore.
|I didn't see that count(). But then we have a double count() in dependencyUtility.
|It's fine with me. I wait for other reviews to minimize patch sets
|I think this is wrong from rebase and should be changed
|As this value may be used in any third party hook, I would like to close the XSS. Will push a new patch
|Shouldn't this be 2774 as mentioned in the forge issue?
|As this is the permission for directories consider 2774 as mentioned in forge ticket
|The default value for files was defined with 0665 before.
|This only is a problem if files and folders within this node are not writeable.
|This cannot be fixed automatically.
|but current permissions are
|This cannot be fixed automatically
|but file permissions are
|Why don't we check for an array if we expect $recordInDatabase to be one?
|We do have to delete new folders as well! Imagine an upload without ext_emconf.php but backdoor php -&gt; it has to be removed if installation failed.
|Guess this was taken from the other function. But yes, it means file extension.
|Never mind, this is done because of the rebase than
|Do we still use @see annotation?
|rsaauth is not meant to be changed within this patch. This should go into another cleanup patch.
|This has nothing to do with the issue and should go into another clean up patch.
|Would like to store the value in a variable before for debugging reason
|what do you mean? - This was just a notice, why i would like to store the return of the function in a variable.
|Just check for isset() and you can skip the else part
|I would love to check for both fields, to be sure the issue is really solved.
|As the exception is in english as well I don't know if it would be helpful to have a translation here
|This was introduced by Markus
|IMHO this is hard to find as it is output directly and should be still readable
|This was introduced by Markus
|I think this is needed as we have to show all dependencies at once. Otherwise you would lost readability
|There isn't any view if an error is thrown :-(
|This is for the installation right after upload I guess.
|As the exceptions are all not translated but in English, I would recommend to not translate this additional link.
|why do we need a reset anyway?
|Do we really need both variables each time just to set the string?
|IMHO saver to use is_object
|could we simplify the variable to $localConfigurationBackupFilePath?
|I would prefer the way it is as this is used core wide and in extjs itself
|How could you iterate over $configMethods if it isn't an array? This should throw at least some warnings
|is_null() equals $saltedHash === NULL which is more common in core
|Why was the $mode parameter added?
|&quot;superchallenged&quot; isn't used anymore so this is always true and can be removed,
|$instance === NULL
|I don't see any reason for blowing this up?
|Isn't the TCA loaded automatically?
|The instanceof check was done one line above. Why is the object forced to be a Comparision?
|I don't get why we should send any return as this is a shutdown function?!
|Done

|No because in every action the rendered view or a plain string is returned. No need for an array!
|Haven't seen this json_encode(). Done
|view-&gt;render() always returns a string
|Done
|As far as I know type hinting has to be absolute.
|This might be wrong - if an extension is deleted the tables don't get deleted right away. So maybe better wording would be &quot;i.e. deleted through database analyser&quot;

First thought you delete a table if it isn't available in TCA (or equivalent checking) anymore.
|The identifier is given here
|why is a Path given to identifier function?
|Should you check the status before trying to fix permissions?
|Why is an object instantiated?
|This shouldn't be no problem now as the port is set independent from any host name (see above). I tested this with name local.local 

Have you really tested the patch?
|this sets 127.0.0.1 as default value. If there is any other local value nothing is changed at all. This allows databases on 127.0.0.2 eg
|Okay, fine with me
|Would it make sense to test 127.0.0.1 and 127.0.0.255 as margin value as well?
|see above
|Maybe another test with the right scope but ip higher than allowed?
|I would prefer if (!empty())
|see above
|the minimum should be $start
|maybe $GLOBALS['TSFE']-&gt;register['FILES_COUNT'] = min($limit, $availableFileObjectCount);
|may initialize $fileObjectCounter = 1 for better counting opportunities
|what is the rtrim for? maybe should be handled in a different way?
|please use generalutility::fixWindowsFilePath and only rtrim '/'
|could you store the information in an own variable
|Just because of feature freeze. would it make sense to have a signal for uninstalling an extension?
|This would be the same behavior as before. But the extension title is needed without regarding any install status and configuration file.
|Done
|Done
|This doesn't work because there isn't any access to the abstract functions anymore.

|Database connection and ext localconfs are not loaded by default. This function is used for salting install tool passwords as well (other path). In the ext localconf of saltedpasswords is the definition of encryption methods. So we need to check if the configuration is included.
|Done
|Please replace &quot;title&quot; with &quot;title tag&quot; and remove one &quot;of&quot;
|Not sure in which other cases you would need this function. As it is related to the exec-function I would suggest to keep the names.
|foreignTable is used to quote row values as well which is necessary for dbal. So no empty value allowed I would say.

|Remove namespace as it is injected
|I was told that each exception has to get its own unique id (timestamp) even if it is the same problem. Maybe we should consider to refactor the check in an own function to get rid of that
|Why was the surrounding if statement removed?
|This function (convertPlainArrayToTypoScriptArray) will be removed in current version so it should be replaced.
|Not sure if this is a good description of the function
|This means that every storage pid exists twice. Not sure but this may be slows SQL queries.
|See BackendConfigurationManager
|Tests missing in current class. Not sure but maybe a git rebase is needed?
|The other two tests from BackendConfigurationManager should exists in FrontendConfigurationManager as well.
|I'm not that into the update wizard yet. IMHO it's safer to keep them and drop with later release. If you say do it, of course I adjust the patch
|Wouldn't it be better to set up a new variable and use this?
|I would prefer an empty() test
|see before (and maybe other statements as well)
|This is the one from the switch
|This is the code which throws the deprecation warning to remove unsupported types with 6.1

This was asked by other reviewers and IMHO is needed to drop it.
|Shouldn't we use the extbase comment header?
|Please insert a line break before comment.

|Why do you add two subgroups? Those should be own tests then
|removeSubgroupRemovesSubgroup

|Just minor: Pop vs. POP
|By reading: is this really true? How can unknown processed files be deleted?
|This should be handled in the upgrade wizard itself and unnecessary for the users!
|Can we remove 6.2.13 version for master
|Can't you check instance of before calling the two functions and separate the file_exists (or add a return if not an instance of composer ClassLoader class)
|Do you have to insert an if (is_callable()) as well?
|Any reason your not checking 'getClassNameForAlias' as this one is called afterwards?
|Should we introduce own exception classes here?
|IHMO we need this to handle multiple simultaneous requests.
|Still the question what can $composerClassLoader be, that the function isn't callable? Maybe a check against NULL is sufficient?
|Should there be a second test for autoload_classaliasmap.php as well so if one of the two files are missing the cache is rebuilt?
|No TODO without forge ticket ;-)
|If FALSE
|Is this really important for the array element?
|Add PackageInterface as type prefix
|I would recommend here to use \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::fixWindowsFilePath and work with unix paths to prevent separator mixes.

Otherwise you get something similar to typo3conf/ext/bootstrap_package/Classes\\Hooks\\DataHandler.php
|see above
|see above
|Do we have to add a new line here as well?
|Still the question: What might happen that the function is not callable and should there be any test for $classLoader-&gt;addClassMap($classMap); as well?
|typo3temp/autoload/
|Should the file names go to own constances as well?
|IMHO not patch related
|We have because you can't use openSsl encryption on Windows systems for performance reasons

|@package isn't used anymore.
|What does this test do? Maybe you should use a mock object to monitor some function calls,
|evaluateFieldReturnsMd5HashForMd5HashedPassword
|evaluateFieldValueReturnsEmptyStringForInvalidPassword
|Maybe you should wrap the test in your class so it can be mocked within the test.
|see above. IMHO you should be able to test your functions without extension dependencies. Otherwise you always have to enable/disable the extensions to execute all tests.
|post -1

This prevents any accessibility checks from \TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\ContentObject\ContentObjectRenderer::getWhere

e.g. now pages which are restricted for website groups are fetched as well
|We should add an information as above
|Superfluous parentheses
|As this goes to html directly use hsc() here as well
|Do we need to reset the params for every method?
|see above
|Don't see any reason to switch to an AccessibleMock here?
|Sorry, didn't see before, that you pass variables by reference. AFAIK we don't want to this in core anymore but split the result array of the dispatch function.
|Receives
|parentObject
|would prefer &quot;any kind of processing&quot; instead of &quot;arbitrary processing&quot;
|Don't needed here
|Signal and function name should always be the same. So either function emitBeforeProcessingRecord or signal name &quot;befaoreAnalyzeRecord&quot;
|Either rename the signal or function name. Variables shouldn't be passed by reference.
|No ObjectManager necessary. Just return Dispatcher with GeneralUtility
|see above
|no else needed.
|Do we have to support more than one queue?
|I would prefer a new property to set and get an identifier for a controller than to store multiple queues in an array
|If we would have getter and setter on controller level we don't need any argument in the view helper. We could simply use the controller context and get the current identifier.
|If you have to change the expectation of the unit test, this patch should be marked as breaking chance and not be backported!
|Array with record information
|IMHO it would be better to pass the record array to the user function
|All other hooks use 't3lib/class.t3lib_userauthgroup.php' as key. Not sure if we should stay to this key to streamline the API
|Please don't change the API here! useCacheHash should be boolean always.
|Any reason why the function is called and the property isn't used directly?
|IMHO not necessary and wrong when useCacheHash === NULL
|Why do you use list() here? BackendUtility::getTSCpid returns always an int value
|See above.
|We can use an early return here
|See above.
|Wrong return value as the function should return an int value
|We should check for negative values and exclude them here. See BackendUtility::getTSCpid comments.
|Here I would indeed use list() to have proper variable names for both return values!
|I don't see any problem here. I've tested this again with a user with two file mounts of the same storage and it works.
|as this isn't used by now I would prefer that the setting doesn't return itself

|Should we add another quoteJSvalue here as well?
|And here?
|The variable was quoted before and should be quoted here as well.
|Ah, sorry. Mixed up that ?:
|not needed here
|Remove double brackets
|Can we add a check if the path is within the document root before creating it?
|Should we check for is_callable() here?

|Should we ensure each line only once with an array_unique() before? Now the RTE Css is included multiple times. If we use array_unique() we could use the $resultArray['additionalHeadTags'] even for JS files.
|Can you maybe test with opcache?
|Okay, we tested and added it now.
|This is wrong! ext_emconf.php is still needed and will be needed.
|No, I don't think so ;-)
|Yes we need it for unit testing ;-)
|As the old package is outdated I want to free the space and make sure it isn't used anymore
|The encryption isn't bind to the backend extension. IMHO it should belong to rsaauth itself. API had to change that's why the wrong function is called here. Will push an update
|TBH I don't see any reason why the PageRenderer should be passed as argument. It is a singleton class and only one instance can exists core-wide. Why should extension authors care about that?
|No. The encryption isn't bound to a login anymore. We can have something like TYPO3RsaEncryptionPublicKeyUrl and if you want to add the function to choose between requiredJS and vanilla JS it isn't even bound to the frontend anymore.
|Because BackendUtility::getAjaxUrl always returns an absolute path starting with '/' itself.
|Why we should decouple it from global variables? I don't see any advantage.
|This is to provide the possibility to add own code like the old eId script did. The function getRsaPublicKeyAjaxHandler can only be called from AjaxHandler context.
|See other comment
|This breaks the submit handler!
|The prefixId is used in \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Service\AbstractService the other two properties aren't used anywhere. Seems to me as copy &amp; paste artifacts.
|Right. In BE context the requireJS module is always loaded. In FE either separate files (debug mode) or a minimized file is added.
|Done
|Done
|It is only this function which should be static to avoid unneeded objects for that integration.
|Done
|Done
|Do we need this here or can we move it to the submit handler?
|Why is it important here?
|Should we simply merge those files in one? Than we can use it as RequireJS dependency and can do further (file) cleanups for rsaauth.
|That's what we do with jquery as well ;-)
|Done
|Done
|Should be renamed as now RequireJS module can be used in BE and FE
|Don't know how to reproduce your error. Of course this defines the loading order for RequireJS. Please see http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#jsfiles
|Then propose any other way!
|We can go back to the function before which worked fine.
|Done
|Thought about having only one instance here. But DataHandler stores all hook objects in an own array, so I removed SingletonInterface.

|if the extension isn't within this array, it is not on the file system at all
|In which case do we need those information? The needed array key 'versionString' isn't defined in ext_emconf.php
|$this-&gt;extensionDetails should be defined in the abstract with an empty array as well
|IMHO file_get_contents is used by GeneralUtility::getUrl as default if curlUse is disabled?!
|This is needed if you submit the form with &quot;enter&quot;. checkAndDoSubmit sets an internal parameter which triggers the saving of the form fields. Otherwise nothing would be saved as the image position parameter are missing.
|Not sure if we should do this. That would mean you can't use any own function with rsaInputElements. I think function is really useful to validate the strength of a password and is even used by multiple extension to implement a password guideline.
|See above.
|Will do that this evening
|I don't see any reason to extend the InputElement as we don't use any function from it
|To be honest, I'm not happy with the change here. IMHO StringUtility::beginsWith does a lot more value testing than necessary and might throws errors which aren't caught here!
|Still I don't see any reason for this check here
|We're still not able to deactivate any languageField-handling
|The documentation says it is a stdwrap-field but there wasn't any stdwrap-handling before. For security reasons I would opt to remove it again. Otherwise we would have to make sure that an existing field within the table was returned to make the query work.
|IMHO there isn't any option yet, to disable the languageField e.g. to get all records without language check. Even if languageField = 0 is set, the language field is set, if the table supports it. This is because the stdwrap function doesn't parse the current value.
|IMHO we can delete this check as the other ones would fail without proper TCA as well.
|Are you sure you can remove a public function without deprecate it before? Should we add a .rst file?
|Don't get why an id has to be hsc'd
|Would have chosen to check the uid.
|Not sure if it is helpful to throw an error here as the whole backend isn't accessible anymore then.

|Shouldn't this be hcs'd too?
|Decided to stop the hook processing if an avatar was found.
|Any reason for this? This is only a database request which can be reused within the core.
|here we need still the proper extension key
|array
|Any reason why you have minored the padding here? Setting it back manually works as well and feels a bit more airy.
|Should be done without the trim, but space after parent
|Why don't we use addExtOnReadyCode() anymore?
|The registration with addExtOnReadyCode doesn't depend on a loadExtJs() before. And as this call is done in FormEngine anyways the code gets included in the output. I prefer to use the addExtOnReadyCode() function to prevent multiple Ext.onReady(function() {}) functions in the code.
|AFAIK we prevent references in signals! You can user list() here to get the new file name.
|Do we really need a constants here?
|We should prevent the reference here as well.
|This isn't the name of the signal but the name of the constants.
|Wrong path in example
|Why don't we use the ImageViewHelper anymore and simply overwrite the render method? Then we don't need to care about the initialization stuff.
|But as the function doesn't return anything else than NULL it doesn't make any sense to have an unused returned statement here
|Sorry, but the return statement is not there to give a hint about what might be returned but what is the actual return of the functional implementation. As the function returns NULL every time, there is no way it returns a ResponseInterface. BTW the other implementation never returned NULL as far as I can see, so the comment was wrong as well.
|We can remove the ResponseInterface here
|How is the change related to the issue? Is it really necessary to add an additional autoload folder? Can't we maybe add the folder flush before (and after) the tests?
|If we are in a &quot;Testing&quot; environment, I wouldn't call the constant DEV but TEST
|Still think, that the image shouldn't care about the path but the API using it should care.
|do we really need that comment in here?
|Why we need an additional variable? Is the implode in the foreach cached or done for every element to find out if the loop finishes? Furthermore debugging an existing variable is more handy then &quot;thinking&quot; the explode.
|Can we use GeneralUtility::intExplode here and use this array in the foreach underneath and implode it in the sql statement?
|an
|Maybe we don't need the extension key here as the Package already stores the key itself. But I really prefer the real extension name set in ext_emconf.php
|I would prefer to have a difference between packageKey and name. I would always set the packageKey to the real extension key and set the name from $extensionManagerConfiguration['title']. As example this would mean &quot;News system&quot; vs. &quot;georgringer/news&quot; for news extension.
|I would prefer to set the description from $extensionManagerConfiguration['description'] and set the $extensionManagerConfiguration['title'] as name
|As far as I can see, this can't happen? $composerManifest is always an instance of stdClass
|Line 897: $composerManifest = $composerManifest ?: new \stdClass();
|Is it necessary to check for an array here? maybe we can unset it if it is set?
|To take care of temporary mounts, we check if the root is in current used mountpoints
|we have to add hsc
|This seems to be unrelated to the ticket issue and should go into an own patch.
|s.a.
|I don't see any requirement to TYPO3 here?
|This is a know string to a site
|Maybe we can dissolve this dependency and fetch the information inside the system check itself.
|s.a.
|I see there is the file need. Fine with me to leave the test in setup then.
|s.a.
|Maybe we can integrate this function into the system check and move the check over.
|Just another thought on this. Does it make sense to iterate over all upgrade wizards and set the done to prevent any further issues?
|Remove phpdoc return statement
|I'm not sure if we should attach &quot;$this&quot; as parameter here. The upgrade wizards might expect an object of class \TYPO3\CMS\Install\Controller\Action\Tool\UpgradeWizard which calls the upgrade wizard generally.
|Done
|Done
|Yes we need the value for the registry to be serialized as the Registry object works in that way.
|We don't use the constructor arguments at all. But this is public API to register upgrade wizards, isn't it?!
|Done
|as it tests
|As 0 is matches as empty, we need to check for NULL to ensure the property wasn't set before
|We leave the call here at it is faster then the anonymous function.
|I think this isn't needed here as __toString() calls the render function itself.
|Can we move the object initialization out of the condition as it is now used in both parts.

|Any reason for storing this in a variable?

|Second parameter here as well.
|I now understand the situation. There is an attribute onsubmit bound directly to the form itself. This is executed before any other event is triggered by JavaScript. 

The other jQuery on('submit') registrations are executed afterwards.

Therefore the form is submitted by the onsubmit attribute as well as the trigger('submit') inside rsa encryption.

So this is right to remove the onsubmit attribute and execute it afterwards.
|This isn't needed anymore if we delete the other handlers.
|Do we have to remove the original-onsubmit data here again?

|Sorry, I don't get it. Where do you want to fake argv in BE context? Still I'm against simply setting $_SERVER['argv'] as this somehow simulates a CLI context which isn't there. As we haven't any parameter here I don't see any other possibility to set the $argv parameter to a correct value.

And IMHO we shouldn't blow up the classes just to be able to set an empty array from some scheduler classes in BE context.
|No it doesn't.

The ArgvInput Class sets the incoming $argv parameter to $_SERVER['argv'] if its null. 
In backend context (when running the scheduler task) $_SERVER['argv'] is not present, so $argv stays null. array_shift triggers a warning then.
|So you want to set $_SERVER['argv'] in BE context? -1 for this fake. In CLI $_SERVER['argv'] is set and taken into account with this patch.

Should we switch to join() here to improve readability?

[BUGFIX] Evaluate &quot;boolean /stdWrap&quot; properties correctly

stdWrap sub-properties on boolean properties were not evaluated
correctly.

Resolves: #75493
Related: #60135
Releases: master
Change-Id: I7ab418a97228beb49458fa43e5d0ce50aef83877


All other comments should go to forge ticket!
|removing this check throws multiple warnings because $conf[$functionProperties] in array_intersect_key($this-&gt;stdWrapOrder, $conf[$functionProperties]) might don't be set
|I don't get the difference here as $sortedConf already includes $this-&gt;stdWrapOrder values.
|Please add this description to the forge ticket, not to the commit message
|As $sortedConf is used only in foreach() loop and we only need the keys, I changes it here.
|Here is the different behaviour. The type is fetched from functionName without any dot at the end
|This test is correct by accident. If I provide a default value, I would expect the default value because of incomplete cObject definition. But currently the result is always empty. I will push an update with a proper test.
|Forward slashes are not problem. Windows can handle forward and backward slashes and even a mix of them
|Core wise the permissions shouldn't be thrown anymore, but in \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\ResourceStorage::createFolder there is a signal which can be used by extensions which might throw own exceptions. I opt to leave it this way.
|IMHO this is needed as the identifier starts with a slash but the createFolder() expects a (valid) folder name
|!empty()?
|disabled=&quot;disabled&quot;
|If you add spaces to the variables above, you can skip them here
|variable name missing
|We should remove the api annotation.
|We should remove the api annotation.
|This can be removed because (new) drivers are needed in FE as well, am I right?
|This would prevent any other adaptation afterwards
|will add empty() checks here, as i might isn't a bool value or not set
|Should this return a string here?
|Added this as RootLevelRestriction
|array
|no need to insert it here
|I would slightly change this test and remove aTable from buildExpression's first parameter and check for an empty result - we already tested the correct restriction building

|Not true. E.g. cache configuration uses human readable strings as well. To be honest, I don't want to unset something like $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['fluid']['interceptors'][1462869116] because then I don't have any clue, what the unset does!
|Pushed an update with use statements. I'd like to add that to the example to help developers to be able to start quickly with implementation.
|Why don't we use the full namespace here? This is improper PHP
|Done

|No it doesn't.

contentIsNotLockedForEditors() does:
$this-&gt;CALC_PERMS &amp; Permission::CONTENT_EDIT) === Permission::CONTENT_EDIT
where this-&gt;CALC_PERMS comes from $this-&gt;getBackendUser()-&gt;calcPerms($this-&gt;pageinfo)

$this-&gt;getBackendUser()-&gt;doesUserHaveAccess does:
$userPerms = $this-&gt;calcPerms($row);
return ($userPerms &amp; $perms) == $perms;

=&gt; it does perfectly the same!
|This function returns a string even if the value is null. Now the return of the whole function is changed. I will push a follow-up
|but it was done always like that and so we enforce this version in other setups.

|has to go into the if as there isn't anything to be closed if no resource
|SoloFieldContainer

|SoloFieldContainer
|This has to be changed as well.
|For better readability I would prefer the inline annotation of both functions.
|I just wanted to say why I changed that ;-)
|Can we rely on numeric arrays here or do we have to take care about stdWrap?

The documentation says that stdWrap can be used. Is it resolved in this place already?
|I guess the header isn't shown for a security reason in frontend.

|Right, the sole function in the constructor was remove and an empty constructor function was left. any purpose?
|Why wasn't the constructor removed here?
|Do we really want to fetch deleted records? I see this was done like that before, but does it make any sense actually?
|Same question here: do we really need to tackle deleted pages?
|does fetch() close the database pointer here or do we have to set a limit?
|As far as I can see, this is a string. Can we use !empty() here?
|line break here?
|this should be sys_language !

|IMHO the additional brackets aren't needed, are they?

|it is. but it is used like this and i don't want to break anything here. unfortunately there was no hint why it was used like that before.
|to be honest, i would consider this one a task and backport it to 7.6 as well. this is a really needed feature for editors.
|missing new line above
|we can add a break; here to return from the loop, can't we?
|any reason for that parameter within the protected function? if it is used for functional testing, I would consider an own property for that. please don't use a parameter here.
|IMHO this should be the current default, shouldn't it?
|I think it is not about any TSconfig option, but a visual section with the user settings. So no example needed here.
|To be honest I don't get your argumentation here. The patch introduces a new feature. Why would it not be part of this patch to clean up existing code? Even introducing some constants is not breaking as you wouldn't change the content of the constants.
|should we add some constants for those strings?

|This is merged. Can this go now?
|please add parent:initializeArguments(); before
|Why was this moved to a public function?
|missing new line before
|IMHO if $hiddenfield is NULL empty($GLOBALS['TCA'][$table]['columns'][$hiddenField]) is true and its not used furthermore
|This is to ensure there is either the hidden icon or an empty icon to align all buttons available. (Imagine there is one record which the user doesn't have access to but all others in the table are editable)
|Done
|IMHO this one has to stay. Will push a new patch set
|Due to fluid generation of checkbox field this value can be empty which results in an invalidValue exception
|missing parent::initializeArguments() here
|Those variables are not needed and can be passed as This-&gt;arguments to the static function
|Because we might need some initialization in the abstract one day and are worrying why those viewhelpers not working anymore. BTW: we had that problem when fluid standalone was introduced and registered some arguments in the Tagbase abstract viewhelper!
|missing parent::initializeArguments() here
|missing return
|Wrong migration here. getWhereClauseForEnabledFields() checks for $this-&gt;getEnvironmentMode() === 'FE' &amp;&amp; $GLOBALS['TSFE']-&gt;sys_page

|Due to cleanIntArray usage in Typo3DbQueryParser the databaseHandle is still needed
|I would say that the interface function can be removed already.
|either one of those modules
|The password will be transmitted encrypted, won't it?
|RsaEncryption.registerForm(LoginRefresh.$loginForm.find('#beLoginRefresh')[0]);
|haven't noticed the $loginForm is used here
|in fact !empty() check is much more cleaner to check for an initialized frontend
|IMHO this affects images as well. Does this work?
|As far as I saw there are different TYPO3_CONF_VARS used. Not sure how to deal with that.
|The constructor uses $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['BE']['filePermissions'] here is $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['BE']['fileExtensions'] in use.
BTW: $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['BE']['filePermissions'] isn't configured in the default configuration. Is this another problem?
|To be honest I would either move the makeinstance into here or save the object in an own property.
|Now you consider every table where rootLevel is not set, can be inserted at root page - which is wrong!
|Haven't found any logDeprecation() function. Can you explain what you want me to do here, please?
|I would solve the problem in the splitQueryStringToArray method as there should be a filter for invalid parameter names
|This is not valid for the xml files included in this change.
|We cannot use ReflectionObject here as the test case defines dynamic properties of an object and expects them to be excluded from this function. I decided to early return for stdClass and use ReflectionClass for all other objects.
|My guess: ReflectionClass can handle objects because if its class names and the reflection of the class itself. StdClass doesn't define any properties nor methods. So the real object has to be analyzed.
|No, ReflectionClass can't handle stdClass properties. This is the reason for the difference here. There is an unit test for this already which fails when using ReflectionClass only.
|I thought using ReflectionClass is a bit more sufficient in speed and memory. Should we always use ReflectionObject instead?
|This can't work because you are looking for a path but not for the module name. Using require.specified('TYPO3/CMS/Rsaauth/RsaEncryptionModule') worked for me here.
|Talked to Helmut and this is due to a change from psr-0 to psr-4 namespacing. So there is no other way to upgrade here.
|I would recommend to do this minor update in an own patch. Got a fatal error during composer install for the installer.
|To be honest I don't get the mix of tabs and whitespaces now. What is the right to use here?
|This is a new change id for the backport. Just want to mention the old one is I0fb2b4632bef05912a329553b70f26d614a1ba9c
|FALSE in 6.2
|FALSE
|TRUE
|hm why would you prefer it that way? I thought the smallest function goes first.
|Have I missed something?! This is done already to avoid duplicate code. Where do you see duplicate code here?
|IMHO this is escaping at the wrong place. The action generates json and sends it back to the browser. I would prefer to enforce the &lt;br&gt; tags in JS or CSS (white-space: pre-line;)

|fieldArray contains the control fields as well. There is no way to get out of control fields and do correct sorting in one step
|This is the result of your statement above:
array (
  'username' =&gt; 0,
  'usergroup' =&gt; 3,
  'email' =&gt; 4,
  'disable' =&gt; 5,
  'admin' =&gt; 6,
)

as the fieldArray is flipped, it stores the numeric keys as values. So you need to assign the real database values to that array afterwards.
|Isn't this the same as 0?
|see above
|Maybe I'm wrong, but this class already has a getTemplatePaths from \TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\Rendering\RenderingContext::getTemplatePaths
|annotation not needed here
|annotation not needed here. Why have you introduced the variable?
|it returns even if not so. I would suggest to remove the if part here
|any reason for supporting the 9 LTS as well? In general I would suggest to mark the compat classes as @deprecate in the phpdoc comment
|superfluous
|where is the parameter argument gone?
|haven't seen that it extends the Uri\TypolinkViewHelper
|superfluous
|please add parent:initializeArguments(); before
|I really don't understand why you would expect an error to be triggered if the current target is not the expected link to typo3_src here. IMHO the structure is only need for the updater. Not for a working instance of TYPO3. IMHO your expectation is wrong here? Why is it a good way to enforce that link?
|Technically t3ver_wsid belongs also to version module. The check for an enabled workspace module isn't used anywhere else. IMHO we can add $this-&gt;getWorkspaceId() &gt; 0 as check.
|What does again mean? I haven't found this setting in any other static template. This is why I think it is a change and can only be done in the current master.
|Done
|Done
|Done
|I'm not sure if it is a good idea to backport that patch. IMHO it is to breaking for existing systems.
|that
|new line for @see annotation
|Yes, this is the property taken into account on resolving markers like ###CURRENT_PID### in foreign_table_where clause.
|Feel free to change that. I'm not in doctrine API and just took \TYPO3\CMS\Install\Updates\FileListIsStartModuleUpdate as a working update wizard
|see above
|Don't know. There isn't any check for erros yet which might can change the return of the upgrade wizard.
|By reading the old (and new) code there isn't any caching for an empty $value without no id. That's why an early return doesn't change the behaviour at all.
|Okay, I'm not into that whole stuff, as you are. But if we don't want any processing for an empty value, then we can simply go to if (empty($value)) return $res;
|I vote for hardcoding stuff in tests ;-)
|can't this be a hard-coded int?
|can't we use `if (!empty($tcaFieldConf['dbType']) &amp;&amp; empty($res['value']))`?
|I know, but for date-/time fields $res['value'] is always returned.
|Why don't we want to use the placeholder for empty (null) values?
|It is not like getRecord as the method parameter change.

It &quot;just&quot; overlays an available record row (without fetching the record itself from the database).
|IMHO no bool return here
|why is this a static function?
|Not used anywhere. Do we have to keep it?
|no bool
|what about tests for the overlay as well?
|Just as side note: hsc is done in InputLinkElement.php:211
|Can you explain (to me) what you mean? I got, that we want to get rid of BackendUtility::getRecord() but do you mean you would start dataProvider-execution for just the record title?
|Done
|Done
|Done
|Please don't use insertData here as this can lead to security issues. Please use dataWrap instead for your example.
|of course this needs to be false now

btw: it is double encoding ;-)
|IHMO it would be more readable to surround the whole string with hsc, not every part on its own.

|I know it is not broken on master but extensions might use that class for their links as well. I would opt to add that fix to master as well.
|IMHO this is highly breaking as the function is used by many plugins in different circumstances. Now every time hidden records are allowed to be shown, more restricted records are shown as well. For me this is a real security problem as the end user might not have any rights for those (new) records!

I don't want another javascript method addicted to one task. Please add a function where you can register the form fields which should be encrypted.
|Patch Set 17:

I discussed the issue with Christian Kuhn and we both decided that this patch doesn't solve the whole problem. Before fixing anything in the login form we need to refactor the rsaauth and the felogin itself. Besides it doesn't make any sense to secure any form data transfer when the password is stored plain in the database.
|Patch Set 17:

@Reinhard: For new installations rsaauth and saltedpassword are enabled in backend and frontend. For installations which are updated saltedpasswords is used only the backend, the use in the frontend isn't changed. Even rsaauth isn't activated by the core if it's diasbled so far.

I'm against that patch. I do not see to offer any update to a non-compatible extension. If one needs an update it can be done manually. We don't know why the extension isn't compatible and as api changes between TYPO3 CMS versions we don't know if anything breaks on update.

@Dmitry How would you like to fetch your entries and sort the translations in correct order? Maybe your usecase is valid for a bug fix but doesn't force a whole revert especially as the patch was merged more than 2 years ago

@dmitry And just to be sure. The first SQL is not how the records get translated it is just for Ordering etc. Further down in code the parent is caught and a proper translation overlay is done

Please difference between real sites and functional tests. Of course having the path in the header link field still works in FE. But there isn't a reference built than. In functional tests we need the change because it tests the reference and the xml is used for several tests.

We can add an Update Wizard for the field for 6.2 but with another patch.

@Helmut: The class name in 6.2 is wrong as well but in this version signal names are handled as plain strings. But after ::class conversion the wrong class name is still used. It seems that PHP can handle even unknown class names correctly but I wouldn't trust on it. As this was introduced in 2014 I'm not sure weather it has to be deprecated. But for backwards compatibility I would to it this way.

Just do verify as I tried to dig into this. The mentioned error doesn't occur in TYPO3 &gt; 6.2 as no loadTCA is needed and the column information are available always. So is this one still valid to be fixed?

As this is not needed in TYPO3 6.2 and above this patch is abandoned now. The TCA is initialized always so the call to enableFields() doesn't raise any error anymore.

As spoken with Christian Kuhn we can't simple iterate over all caches and clear by tag as the performance impact is to high in comparison to the benefit. We need to introduce proper cache and tag management to core with communication and maybe a switch to turn it on/off

I did some code style and some unit tests improvements. But I still think you can't set any basis for calculation if you only get a count of seconds. IMHO we need to functions. One just calculation the seconds to a string and one which returns the age depending on today.

* Added a function for simple age calculation independent from any start- or enddate

I slightly changed the dialog box behavior. To prevent undesired installations, the event is now triggered by the unfocused &quot;No&quot; button which means you have to read the warning more carefully.

@Nadir: This is not a patch issue, because the dependency gets lost when installing the extension locally. It seems that there is an error while packing the tx3 on the server.

As spoken with Oliver a silent installation is not that easy and maybe confusing for the user, so the action redirects to the list/error page.

@Klaas Johan Kooistra if you have a look at the other core tests that is exactly what we are doing. Using setup is not a good solution.

@benni it is not just dependency to extension. It's because CSC is basis for most of the sites!
|Patch Set 3:

Hi Felix,

as felogin for example is loaded on installation, setting CSC as required extension would have the same impact. And I think the most obvious reason to use an CMS is to have both FE and BE. So I would say using TYPO3 as backend only is not a circumstance we have to take care of as standard use case

@Oli: Your problem was because of wrong brackets which avoids the set_include_path

To load the local PHPUnit instance we have to do:

- include the autoloader (this sets the PHPUnit autoloader function)
- as composer prepends its autoloader unregister PHPUnit autoloader
- load composer and vfsStream autoloader
- prepand PHPUnit autoloader again

otherwise alwayse the delivered PHPUnit is used

I tested it with an old PEAR version of PHPUnit.

|Patch Set 11:

Still not confident with the patch here. IMHO we should really try to solve this in another way for 6.2 without any Upgrade Wizard. Why can't we change the typo3/sysext/frontend/Classes/Page/PageGenerator.php:107 to force a boolean value instead of the string if that is the problem? We can remove the ['GFX'] part within master with another patch, but should really try to lower the barrier for 6.2.13 update!

Anyway I'm still unable to trigger the image problem. Instead for me the image is removed after saving the RTE but shown in FE correctly.

After talking to Mathias I don't see any advantages of this patch. Even if it might be possible to trigger some server checkups before uploading any source, you need the source itself to start the installation. Within this process the TYPO3 checks will be checked and may result in additional errors. IMHO you need the source on the server and have to start the installation process to get a full list of errors/needed adjustments and this patch doesn't seem to help to reduce administration work.

@Benni: Shouldn't we adjust the method name in master first?
|Patch Set 1:

I just took another look into the issue again. I don't know if it is worth to change the implementation here. There are several other places, where the method parameters are changed from parent to child class. I can't even load backend nor frontend without strict warnings.
|Patch Set 1:

@Stephan but then we need to fix all places not only one special, don't we?
|Patch Set 1: -Code-Review
|Patch Set 1:

@Martin: Can you explain your server environment to me? I really tried to reproduce your issue. I have error_reporting = E_ALL enabled in my php.ini but at the very beginning of every (frontend) call, TYPO3 sets error_reporting(E_ALL &amp; ~(E_STRICT &#124; E_NOTICE &#124; E_DEPRECATED)) (in \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Core\SystemEnvironmentBuilder::initializeBasicErrorReporting) which prevents any strict reporting for me. Please be so kind to explain why you see strict messages in your error log
|Patch Set 1:

@martin:

but the errorHandler stuff is set after the packagerManager is initialized. So I still don't understand why the error is triggered as the error_reporting is turned of before?
|Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1 Verified+1

@Helmut: Thank you for further investigations. The provided patch seems to be more complicated but prevents a flow function becoming public available. IMHO this ensures functionality for all kind of extensions which might hook into the bootstrap. And thanks for clarification that this is the only strict error for frontend requests.

I had a look into the &quot;open&quot; upgrade wizard. There are two upgrade wizards which want to change user settings concerning some module changes. IMHO there is really no need to run through all upgrade wizards but it would be sufficient to mark the wizards as done.

If there is any good reason to run through the wizards I opt to create a dummy \TYPO3\CMS\Install\Controller\Action\Tool\UpgradeWizard instance and pass it as constructor argument.

@Morton: Sorry, I don't get your point here. This patch ensures that the default language id is only set if the object hasn't any language id itself. If it has an own language id this gets updated in the updateObject method to set right id. So this patch excately adds the behavior you describe.

Maybe we shouldn't depend on the renderMode only, as the parent field of sys_category is defined with 'renderType' =&gt; 'selectTree',

The typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Migrations/TcaMigration.php ensures a renderType is set always. So IMHO no need to check the deprecated renderMode here

Tested the patch with &quot;2:/_processed_/ftp.zew.de&quot; and it works if either ftp.zew.de is missing or _processed_ was deleted before.

IMHO all methods defined in the driver interface can be reached with the current resource methods. Which function do you use directly through the getDriver() function?

What is the benefit of this and the other patches as new functionality is used from the new version? This makes it harder for extension developers to maintain their versions for different TYPO3 versions. IMHO as long as we don't use new functions there is no need to update to new dependencies

Post -1. Extension installation with dependencies is broken now. JSONView is not able to transform an Extension object.

#1: PHP Warning: Missing argument 1 for TYPO3\CMS\Extensionmanager\Domain\Model\Extension::getCategoryIndexFromStringOrNumber(), called in typo3\sysext\extbase\Classes\Reflection\ObjectAccess.php on line 126 and defined in typo3\sysext\extensionmanager\Classes\Domain\Model\Extension.php line 237
|Patch Set 5:

Extension objects are included in the dependencies array. Just tried to install introduction package which requires bootstrap_package
|Patch Set 5:

JsonView has an own implementation for the transformation of objects with the help of reflections. This is a big change in comparison to the ViewHelper used before.

I think it is worth to streamline the delete information here. Users do not have to enable the extended view and may be used to use the click menu. Here the information that existing references were found is missing and might result in unattended file removements.

|Patch Set 4: Code-Review-2

I talked to Helmut and we came to the conclusion that this is a quick and dirty feature implementation. We suggest to extend the Fluid Standalone to be able to implement own Interceptors which can handle some system-defined output (like wrapping additional information). We will see what we can do for this Standalone feature at the current sprint in Cluj
|Uploaded patch set 5.
|Patch Set 5:

This patch needs an upcoming fix in Fluid Standalone
|Patch Set 5:

I split this patch to introduce new interceptor registration in an own patch. Please lets get this on into the core and merge this patch afterwards.

You can find the new patch here https://review.typo3.org/48055/
|Patch Set 5:

Hi Claus,

Thanks for your feedback. To be honest I don't understand it completely. Maybe you can help out and give me some more information about your vision.
 
 &gt; It would result in much better performance if these parameters were
 &gt; extracted from a debug-adapted TemplatePaths or RenderingContext
 &gt; object - changing the escaping interceptor behaviors is extremely
 &gt; costly in comparison.
 
 I don't see any code which changes the escaping interceptor behavior? My vision was to introduce a way how own interceptors can be added to the configuration (not only for debugging purpose). 
 If I understand the Fluid Standalone code correctly, the configuration object already has methods to register new interceptors but the Fluid Standalone RenderingContext hasn't any API to define own ones.
 
 Therefore I pushes the patch https://review.typo3.org/48055/ to implement the configuration in TYPO3 core itself.
 I see this debug interceptor than as a consumer using the provided core API.
 
 &gt; Placing it there also lets you extract information about namespaces
 &gt; and more.

I don't understand your &quot;there&quot;. Where would you place API to add (in this case) the debug information about paths and sections? As this patch addresses an option in the admin panel, I don't see any good
way how to influence some TemplatePaths or RenderingContext objects without having new core dependencies (checking the status of the admin penal, provided by some globals vars).

 &gt; On the subject of own interceptors: this is already possible and
 &gt; should be done via the RenderingContext-&gt;buildParserConfiguration
 &gt; method. This sets interceptors globally.
 &gt; 
 &gt; https://github.com/TYPO3Fluid/Fluid/blob/master/src/Core/Rendering/RenderingContext.php#L314
 
 As I said, IMHO this patch already uses that API correctly by its own core RenderingContext-&gt;buildParserConfiguration.
 I haven't found any Fluid Standalone way how to influence the used configuration objects and adding own interceptors.
 
 &gt; I would not encourage modifying the interceptors in any other way
 &gt; than this, and if using this way, I would be extremely careful
 &gt; about which interceptors to enable and possibly customise them
 &gt; based on context. A general registry of interceptors that are
 &gt; always loaded seems excessive; targets too broadly. If it really is
 &gt; required to add interceptors dynamically I would recommend that
 &gt; this gets done for example per extension - in other words consider
 &gt; it a setting of the same level and importance as template paths,
 &gt; for example configured in the same TS scope.

I do understand that you would like some TS configuration but don't understand how you would solve the tickets issue, to add a new admin panel configuration which would add the debug output to each extension/plugin.

Maybe you have any idea how to solve both approaches?
|Patch Set 5:

&gt; Although I would not put
 &gt; it in the buildParserConfiguration method, or at least cache it,
 &gt; but that's more of a review of the other patch and not something
 &gt; for this discussion. As far as I am concerned that patch is okay,
 &gt; though like with everything else there's room for improvement.

 Can you add a comment on this to the other patch please (or push a new patch set according to your thoughts)?
 
 &gt; The intention is to output (inline, hidden) HTML when `f:render` is
 &gt; called.
 &gt; 
 &gt; But the chosen tool is to selectively add interceptors which also
 &gt; get compiled. These interceptors must be executed every time a
 &gt; ViewHelper is invoked (to check if that ViewHelper is the one we
 &gt; target).
 &gt; 
 &gt; That is the solution I would not encourage. It is too expensive -
 &gt; and causes differences in compiled templates when user logs out
 &gt; again. Working around *that* compiling issue causes even more
 &gt; checks and conditions which imho just makes it worse.
 
 I don't get your point, sorry. The interceptor is called only if the option in the admin panel was enabled. IMHO if I want to debug any code, I don't care that much about performance. I want the necessary information
 to help me for further development. And we don't know what other interceptors might want to do, so we can't discuss any other situation.
 
 &gt; For this specific use case then it would appear that it's better to
 &gt; - and this is again just an example - use a custom TemplatePaths
 &gt; object that can store the templates you resolved and output this
 &gt; storage as inline HTML somewhere *outside* if the whole
 &gt; compiling/parsing logic of Fluid. Because what you want to debug
 &gt; here is &quot;which templates did I render?&quot; and this information can
 &gt; just as well be collected after rendering finishes. 
 
 This isn't true as it's not that helpful seeing the compiled templates and partials at the end of the site as seeing that information in the content context. The goal of the patch is to help editors find
 the template/partial for a specific content element to be able to adjust that to their needs. Not showing the used templates/partials in general.
 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Another reason I have for suggesting this is the expectation that
 &gt; other things would also be nice to debug. For example, which
 &gt; namespaces a template contains and which ViewHelpers were called
 &gt; with which arguments. 
 
 Showing namepsace information isn't scope of this patch neither. To be honest I don't see any reason why you should need that anyway. Displaying information about used viewhelper with their arguments
 can be handeled by interceptors as well. You get all child nodes and their arguments. So if you want, you could add that to the output as well.
 
 &gt; So yes, I have an idea to solve both approaches:
 &gt; 
 &gt; Manipulate the RenderingContext and the classes it delivers -
 &gt; personally I would do it with a subclassed DebugRenderingContext.
 
 That would add unnecessary dependencies (check if any debug mode is enabled) to the intitialization if the Fluid.
 As I said, I want to prevent any &quot;debug&quot; context which than does magic stuff in the background.

I would kindly ask you to read Claus comments on the implementation details, when working on a new patch set. I tend to add this feature in development context only.

What's the point of the new test class? Isn't this anything we can test in the current test class \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Tests\Unit\TypoScript\Parser\TypoScriptParserTest?
|Patch Set 4:

To be honest I don't get the advantage of this patch. Do you mind to add some additional information about the problems this patch solves to the forge ticket?
|Patch Set 4:

If this is your solution, the TypoScriptParser should go into an own Repository/Package and the patch should care about the implementation of that new package!
|Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1
|Patch Set 4:

&gt; However, to evolve such a central part of TYPO3 to an own package
 &gt; should be done by iteration, step by step.

That is correct, but I don't see any reason why this step by step evolution has to be done in the core.

Thank you for your answer. Is there anyone with insights into linkvalidator who can answer some questions? Is the page information (of a maybe deleted page) used anywhere in the code?
|Patch Set 3:

@Christian: What would be the way to solve the issue in 6.2? IMHO having an indexer task which does not index is critical as it might give unexpected sides affects on the frontend page.
|Patch Set 3:

@Stephan: IMHO even if you would select a storage in the task, the file mounts of the cli user would be taken into account which would still result in not indexed files of a storage

Please split up your test into multiple tests. It is not a code behavior to test multiple issue on one big test. This makes it quite hard to find the breaking test if any of them is invalid.

Wouldn't it be better to keep the escaping where it is needed and remove the default escaping?

The safty net is active without the extension being activated. If some data has to be restored, the extension can be activated, the data can be restored and afterwards it can be deactived again. By default the extension is available for admins only as available user modules have to be defined anyways.

Can verify now that the *headline* is escaped twice. But:

the record title shouldn't be escaped by default but at the points where it needs to be escaped. There are a few more issues dealing with double encoded record titles and there all change the usage of the record title instead of fixing the problem of to early encoded record title.

IMHO have to use hsc with fourth parameter is a good sign for bad code. You only need to encode code where the output is generated (and you know the context of that code). Having double encoded output shows something went wrong before.

@Claus: As far as I saw this change is unrelated to the registration of render() function arguments. So those can still be used
|Patch Set 3:

@Claus: Sorry, Clause but your argumentation is not correct exactly. Both removed methods used an own implementation of the ArgumentDefinition but without the last constructor parameter. So that one isn't turned on anyway. Each usage of the method you mentioned (\TYPO3\CMS\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\ArgumentDefinition::isMethodParameter) is bound to that class. So there is no change in bahaviour. Before that method return false in every way, no the method isn't executed anymore.

I don't see any change in behavouir here but think it is a good patch to remove further own code and stick to the fluid standalone one!

No need to change as add also checks writeable information. See typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Resource/ResourceStorage.php:681
|Patch Set 2:

IMHO write wouldn't be the sufficient permission.
|Patch Set 2:

But then we have to check two flags -&gt; write flag for folder and add flag for files. If I give an user permissions to write to a directory, I don't want him to automatically be able to add new files unless the user has those permissions as well. Normally write access I understand as being able to change files in there
|Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1 Verified+1

Okay, I re-thought about this issue. I was sure that folder-&gt;add means &quot;the user is able to either add files or folders&quot; but then files-&gt;add wouldn't be necessary (and I haven't seen this flag before). The check for user settings doesn't belong to this function and should be done before fetching any upload folder. So I'm fine with the change. But could you add some notes to the forge issue how you found this issue and how to reproduce?

Just my 2 cents:

- IMHO adding functional test classes would break composer installation (by dist) on Windows systems because of the path length (because .gitattributes is not changed for the new infrastructur)

- I would already use a new namespace for the component files as this makes the usage before and after splitting a lot easier

If I understand that right, there are information missing to load in processExtensionSetup(). The information from ext_emconf are not loaded due to getExtensionArray() vs. enrichExtensionWithDetails() in install method. I will have an eye on it and push an update if necessary.

Post -1 as well. Even with the updater and a new option (way) to be able to handle translated data, we do drop the information if a field got its value from the parent because it was empty before (and needs to get further updates if the parent is changed) or the value comes from user input. Currently updating translations with parent information is not possible anymore
|Patch Set 3:

Post -1
I'm sorry but I think we need to revert this change. It is actually important to have an updated extension list, to be able to get information about the (security) status of extensions. A lot of users are using the reports to get automated information about the systems. We do drop a security feature without any replacement. IMHO there isn't any other way to get information about extensions when using composer.
|Patch Set 3:

Sorry, but as long as this repository is not officially maintained by the security team (and currently there isn't any option) this maybe works for you, but is not how we can handle it in the core!

Can we extend this fix, to reload a page tree after a page was added? If I have a parent page and add a new subpage I still see the delete action in parent page context menu
|Patch Set 3:

And to be honest, reloading the page tree each time, isn't a good way to go. The context menu is created on mouse click request, so this generation should be cleaned up then, shouldn't it?!
|Patch Set 3:

I'm still thinking that reloading is not the right way to go. I had a little look into the code and think the property leafNode for the parent node has to be changed on add or delete a subpage

|Patch Set 2:

@Christian: I don't know why you say &quot;and then to allow an update is relatively hacky&quot;. The patch prevents the update with a change to the expected target. 

The thing is that the current state of expected structure is more or less security relevant (as you might know). That is why I don't want to trigger an error if the links don't point to typo3_src inside the same directory! If you have any other idea, about solving the issue, please update the patch.

To prevent different and inconsistence data in the database here, I would suggest to add an upgrade wizard to rewrite the correct hash for each relation. What do you think? This ensures proper data in the database and we do not need any additional handling in the code

You can't tell how I hate this BackendUtility::getRecordTitlePrep function and its usage ;-)
IMHO it is safe to use the raw value here as there is no way (I found) to prevent the escaping of the controller. I added a comment in the commit message as well
|Patch Set 3:

@mathias: yes, moving this whole record title stuff to a view helper would defnitely the way to go. but that would also mean a lot of refactoring and potential new xss issues ;-)
|Patch Set 1:

I tend to not change the status of the message. 1) the information could not be visible enough. 2) This is the reason a few functions are disabled in EM with composer mode. 3) It may be even wrong/bad practice to install/uninstall extensions in EM as this might be done by composer (or deployment)
|Patch Set 1:

Maybe you understand my point of view better, if you don't associate the warning as something a user has to change but as kind of asking for your attention. IMHO there are many warnings out there in the wild, telling you you should care about something (like at the train station or in hospitals).

Feel free to whatever you want. Thanks for listing to my arguments. I'm away from this patch.
|Patch Set 2:

I'm not sure if we really want to support mssql without that options set. IMHO extensions providing a static+adt.sql file rely on the ids the import sets.
|Patch Set 2:

What I just wanted to say, that merging this patch does maybe solve the problem for the core but not for any extension. To be able to use extensions with static+adt sql files you have to change the settings of the mssql database.

If I understand the problem correctly the problem is that the page is not accessible / viewable from backend page tree if a starttime is set. IMHO the right patch has to change the preview url and sets the simulated time correctly instead of lower restriction management.

Hi Christian, Thank you for your comment. Would you mind to explain the risks you see here? It would help me and others to understand why setting a default value for sys_language_uid might be considered was wrong approach to solve the problem.

For a test be, I think you can use any system with at least one language and a tt_content element with assigned assets. You can find a step by step guide at the end of the forge ticket. Furthermore I think we have good test cases by using styleguide and its inline fields.

I already had a look into the code of 6.2 and for setting the default language there isn't much work to do. At least setting relations for already saved (parent) elements works in 6.2 which doesn't work neither in master nor in 7.6. I would consider to call this problem an edge case in 6.2 which is worth to be fixed, but fine with any other decision as well.

Also I guess I have very limited knowledge of that core area, I would love to take part in that conference call.

@Thorsten: what is the reason for your -1 here? Anything to improve from your point of view?
|Patch Set 5:

Hi Thorsten,

thank you for your explanation. Unfortunately I think you missed some changes in FormEngine latly. Due to change https://review.typo3.org/51783 the generated configuration (with the correct language set in foreign_record_defaults) is passed and taken as context information. This is why this patch works as expected in master. Of course the backport has to be changed in 7.6 as the mentioned patch is not backported (yet). This means, the default is set for the child when its information is aggregated from FormEngine after the Ajax request was triggered.

I kindly ask you to test the patch with a current master and rethink your vote. Thank you very much.

|nope, because HTTP_HOST doesn't contain the scheme. You'd have to use TYPO3_REQUEST_HOST and do str_replace or prefix it hardcoded with &quot;http://&quot; which is pretty ugly. I think the scheme neutral way is fine here.

|Shouldn't this be &quot;flushByTag('t3lib_autoloader');&quot; (like in the same class, function writeNewExtensionList)?
|It's because the other two hooks in this class are called render-preProcess and render-postProcess, but we can change the name if you prefer.
|Should this be &quot;Moved Page!&quot;?

|Christian will add the deprecation log... btw: not only is the function not used, $login is also always set to FALSE, so the function actually does not do anything useful in anyway.

|this should implement the interface &quot;tx_form_domain_model_attributes_interface&quot; so the children could just extend the abstract without having to implement the interface again and again. If the abstract implemented the interface you could also define a default getValue function for accept, acceptCharset and all the others that use the same getValue functions, so you'd get rid of all this duplicate code.
|missing $attribute initialization.
|In general: can't we simplify these checks by enforcing value to be a string always? I mean if you cast a string to integer it will be 1 (and TRUE if you cast to boolean) so these checks look like total overkill. And I think it's unclean to allow different types here.

|if $table is now always tt_content we don't need the iteration or the variable and could reduce this code even further, don't you think? I'll have a deeper look tomorrow and try to come up with something better.
|Please ignore my comment...  activeTables can also be set from the outside, so the iteration here is valid as the if takes care of outside tables...
|please rename the variable to something readable.
|please correct the comment (missing parameter description, wrong return description?)
|The abs() is needed in case an element is ready to publish (-10).
|shouldn't this line be removed, too?
|Nope, empty is correct here - as the documentation states:

http://de3.php.net/manual/en/function.empty.php

Returns FALSE if var has a non-empty and non-zero value.

The following things are considered to be empty:

&quot;&quot; (an empty string)
0 (0 as an integer)
0.0 (0 as a float)
&quot;0&quot; (0 as a string)
NULL
FALSE
array() (an empty array)
var $var; (a variable declared, but without a value in a class)

You can test it, config.removeDefaultCss = 0 still inserts the css.
|as far as I know ! throws a php notice if the array is not set while empty does not throw the notice. but I'll look it up again.

|Well, it's pretty ugly to have this strict checking. Would be nice to have a more clever check here ;) (ignoring quotes and whitespaces, line breaks and so on -- what if someone wants to write
t3lib_div::loadTCA(
    &quot;tt_content&quot;
);
?
|what happens if someone used double quotes?
|Thx for explaining, overlooked it.
|is it possible to enter line breaks in the configuration editing input?
|cause = case?
|$table is unfortunately undefined... (which we could fix while we're at this anyway)
|Why are the Collapse All and Expand All labels uppercase and starts with and contains are not?
|This is only setting the defaults if both values are not set - shouldn't we also set a default width / height if one of them is empty?
|I'd prefer the &quot;one line duplication&quot; of this line in the condition -&gt; so we get one block handling routingEnabled - which we can then move to a separate method.
|some error handling for else or return null here or set response var and get rid of the early return?
|I'd separate these two concerns in different classes. One called in the bootstrap for loading the routes to a &quot;route registry&quot;, which is then used for accessing routes.
|is this the correct frontend then? looks ugly ;)
|Please check if we should do validation (intval...) before executing this.
|can you add a comment here, why exceptions are &quot;ok&quot;?
|I don't get where/why this is needed.
|We could abstract this one level further as content and pages are using exactly the same code except for the table name.
|DependencySorter? (sounds stupid, too - but since this is currently in the Utility folder we should be more specific about what is being sorted [Subject of this class is not the order itself, but dependencies afaics]).
|sortBySpecifiedLoadOrder? (Would use sort instead of order, but not sure about the rest of the name)
|except
|should be a number (valid colPos).
|except
|colPos??
|!=
|it's the heat. = is correct. stupid me.
|this static call has to go, too.
|I would not introduce an interface as long as we have just the one implementation and it's pretty unlikely that someone from the outside should implement his own variant.
|(this should of course not be there in the end, was just for getting the tests running)
|from the rst-file: shouldn't select.languageField = 0 disable it?
|is this change intentional?
|I guess wrong var name.
|the whole test class is missing a mock for the iconRegistry to create a deterministic state for the tests. If you had that mock, you'd also add tests for the expectations which methods of the registry are called in what cases. I'd use constructor injection for testability. If you want, I can create an example for you - but later when I'm back on a computer with PHPStorm ;)
|don't test protected methods directly, you test the inner workings of your class by calling and asserting on the public method (in this case you ensure the functionality of wrappedIcon by asserting that the result of your public api is correct).

Imagine you'd inline the complete wrappedIcon functionality in your main getIcon method - that would not change any functionality and should therefor never break a test. Or you extract the html part in a class constant with markers, that get replaced - no change to functionality, nothing should break! This is the single point that allows us to refactor our classes with the insurance that everything works afterwards in exactly the same way. We are making sure that the public API our classes provide keep working no matter what changes we do on the inside / to the implementation. In a way that is the whole point of testing - and why I add this monster comment ;)
|please test the icon markup case with a single dedicated test and not in every test (same as with instanceOf).
|dataProvider
|dataProvider
|...ReturnsNotFoundIcon...
|this use statement is purely used by the IDE never by the code afaics. Do we really add &quot;executed&quot; code for the IDE?
|see other comment.
|changing the order of the hook and assignments could have unintentional side effects, couldn't it?
|??
|Should probably be done with PathUtility::dirname and PathUtility::basename to handle locale settings.
|interesting base ;)
|not? Or was this meant as description of the behavior before the patch?
|TypoScriptFrontendController uses: 
rawurlencode(GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv('REQUEST_URI'))))

and the htmlspecialchars should probably be applied to the full $returnUrl not only the first part?
|for consistency I'd add all the htmlspecialchars down here, so it is clearer that it's done for all the attributes.
|&quot;these&quot; elements
|is there a reason that this condition is not merged with the one above?
|I'd go further, I'd refactor the first one to a method (isInlineField() or something like that) and the second one to another method (isUserAllowedToModify() or something like that.), so the resulting condition would be

if(!isInlineField() &#124;&#124; !isUserAllowedToModify)
continue;
|should probably be $ACCEPTANCE_TESTS
|singular looks strange, as the main headline (administration.statistics) is plural.
|Row count by database table?
&quot;tables rows&quot; sounds weird, but I'm no expert.
|wouldn't it make sense if we have that folder object now to do the rest of the import also via the FAL API?

(folder-&gt;createFile(...)-&gt;setContents(..)?)

or is there a good reason to do all the checking here?
|Done
|missed one.
|why do you add the max here? It's the default anyway (for whatever reason ;)). If you want to ensure that a max is always used here, we should probably use PHP_INT_MAX instead of a &quot;random&quot; number.
|that creates an 'invalid value' for me if I switch between a selected filemount and the empty option. 

I'd guess 0 would work?
|shouldn't that be includeHidden? IgnoreEnableFields would also cause deleted records to be shown, wouldn't it?

|I thought about but then we'd force extension authors to use deprecated code when maintaining compatibility. With supporting this until 9 there is a real chance you can change your extensions' code after the 9 LTS cycle to the new way and again support up to 3 major versions.

|our dear backend user is admin now, does that impact the checks?

And TypoScript is correct because it has an impact if you set specific typoscript settings.
|this is meant to be the column for all row related actions, so the wording here is correct.
|I'd also say as this is admin only, the confirmation is not necessary. As for the icons: the whole table needs a ui rework (word-wrap, column width, naming things ...). I'll take the feature as it is now as I see all that in a separate step.

|why not change createRelationHandlerInstance to get a parameter for the workspaceID? As far as I can see the workspace ID is always set after creating an instance and just in one case it's different from the be_user one, so why not use the be_user as default and make it overwritable?
|this is as far as I can see the only usage of the new protected method - why does the protected method have 4 parameters (and a whole block of code that is not triggered without the third), when we just need the two?
|is the name correct? As far as I understood it just gets the overlaid record and not one overlaid record and one original record?
|I really don't get it. If the point is to introduce another API method, this method should be public, if the point is mere refactoring, it shouldn't have unused parameters. Maybe I just don't get what the end goal of this is. getRecordWSOL is in a completely different class and still has a different signature, so I'm not getting the connection between these two?
|see comment at calling line of this method, this would currently never happen (without XCLASS or something alike) unless I'm not seeing something?
|why not make it final if it's not meant to be subclassed?
|should then be called: skipIfValueIsEmpty
|space
|all the other $more fields start with a space. is there a reason this one doesn't?
|I'll move it in another method because this one is clearly called &quot;defineTypo3ModeBe&quot; ...
|acceptance tests are suggest only and for me probability is low, that you want to run the cores' tests in your setup. so at least styleguide would be over the top.

for the other cms dependencies: where are those needed (aside the acceptance tests?) - I wanted to provide only those dependencies necessary for the unit/functional framework.
|that was exactly what the discussion on decisions was for, as nearly nobody cared to discuss it's now &quot;Components&quot; - and as it's feature freeze, we probably won't change the namespace again. In addition for me &quot;TYPO3/Components&quot; is kind of a product name, so I like plural better.
|yes, the reason was, they are in the core composer.json - maybe we should make a separate patch going through all places where they are mentioned and see if we can get slack and stack overflow in there.
|is anybody still on irc?

|just to make sure I get it: if both are set to different modes, pages wins?
|I'm confused again, in the case &quot;missing allowLanguageSynchronization&quot; you transform the tca from pages with allowlanguageSynchronization to pages_language_overlay - making it look like the tca you use here and call &quot;superfluous allowLanguageSynchronization&quot;. If I fixed my TCA according to the case above wouldn't the migration then remove my behavior field entirely on the next run?
|I didn't add them here in the first place, because I'm not sure about possible side effects if the function is called with another view script that may not work / does not understand these parameters. Can we ensure that this has no side effects? (and we are fetching the pageinfo stuff twice now in a lot of cases - is that a problem?)
|before the patch the identifier was ident_subst... now the ident_ is missing. We are using the ident_ in various other places - is there a reason for that?
|I'll try to give a short explanation: If you checkout a branch, with a non-standard name like TYPO3_8-7 (instead of e.g. 8.7 which would automatically represent a version) composer guesses which version it should use (to resolve self.version for example). As the branch is non-standard composer goes &quot;oh, this is a feature branch, I'll take a look where that feature was branched from and use that as version&quot; --&gt; which in our case always ends up being dev-master - which is wrong as TYPO3_* is our notation for version branches. This option simply tells composer that our TYPO3_* branches are version branches and it should not look for another parent. With this change, self.version is TYPO3_8-7 and with the alias also 8.x-dev - which is useful for the testing framework the core requires, as that needs 8.x as version in self.version. There is more in the composer docs, but I hope that makes it clearer why we need that in this case ;)
|values are only modified if the field is either configured as transOrigPointerField or translationSource?
|this method is only called for distributions anyway, so I'd very much prefer to have your filter code in there (and not here in the controller) - I mean, get Extensions suitable for TYPO3 version is exactly what the it does, especially in combination with the filter ;) 

Additionally the dependency utility has good test coverage *cough*

One case missing in the concept I think: What if I have something like

Now all dependencies get downloaded, too.
|Patch Set 2:

Installation and download themselves are already separate functions (downloadExtension and installDependencies) - somewhat strangely named. But splitting it up further does not make sense in my eyes because the queue handling is needed even in the &quot;don't install&quot; case to also download the dependencies which is the intended goal.
|Patch Set 2:

Question is can we rename the methods without unnecessarily breaking other extension relying on the current behaviour (as the method is public)? What would be your suggestion?

I don't really like this feature. I usually solve subdomain setups with the web server setup. Why would you need to solve these problems on the application level?
|Patch Set 1:

I still don't really get it. If I have several domains I usually have one main domain record for each site and if I want to have aliases I use a different vhost config and redirect the aliases to the main domain (I don't want to have duplicate content anyway).

|Patch Set 16:

Just two questions to clarify the API for me:

- Stacking modals by simply calling the Modal multiple times works and results in multiple modals on top of each other. If I want to dismiss a specific modal that does not work as there is no identifier for the modals, do I get that right?
- When adding a confirmation button, I have to trigger dismiss myself after whatever I did in the trigger method to close the modal (for example -&gt; click button -&gt; do my stuff -&gt; call dismiss) - there is no &quot;auto-close&quot; for a modal where I clicked the button?

We can't be sure what extension authors do, you can never know if the author did not add a userfunction which needs the classes cache to be cleared. I'm for either clearing all caches or clearing none AND add a signal. Last one will probably put more work in the hand of extension authors but as these are the only ones absolutely knowing what caches should be cleared, they should get to decide...
|Patch Set 2:

@Markus: yes, that probably is the only way where we need to clear the classes cache but as an extension author could do whatever he wants (which includes - no matter how ugly - dynamically changing code), we have no way of knowing.
On that note, as we can't know what they are doing, the implementation to only clear the system caches could in itself already be a probably because maybe he wants to change some rendering classes or whatever meaning the frontend caches should be cleared, too. That's why I'm saying let the extension author decide - maybe with a fall back to clear all caches if the extension has clearCacheOnConfigurationChange set (--&gt; like clearCacheOnLoad).
|Patch Set 2: -Code-Review
|Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

In general: yes to the idea, however I'd consider API changes like this one as features - which is why I did not move more methods out of t3lib_div.

Additionally my goal for the new classes is to have them fully unit tested. So let's postpone this patch to after 4.6 release and do it with unit tests then.

|Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Default introduction package start page has no css anymore after clearing all caches :(
|Patch Set 7: Fails; No score


|Patch Set 8: Fails

I'm really really really sorry :( but...

the order of the resource inclusion changes if I change the caching behavior of my extension:


If it is a USER object:

files from extension come first

files from typoscript last


If it is a USER_INT object:

files from typoscript come first

files from extensions last


If it is registered as USER but switched to USER_INT on the fly:

files from extension come first

files from extension last

Last case is especially problematic as both USER_INT variants behave differently. 

The behavior for extension resources should be the same for all types, else it is just unpredictable. 


Especially if you mix USER and USER_INT on a page you get

files from extensions

files from typoscript

files from extensions


Confusing!

TYPO3 4-5 should work on PHP 5.2

I see the following problems with this change

a) no support for different versions (which is bad, as we also want &quot;the frontend&quot; to use the core api and it should be able to decide which version it needs - also we may want to update the backend jquery versions in the future but stay compatible with older code nevertheless.
b) Up until now no API for jQuery extensions/plugins. There should be a registry for extensions and the core to provide information about available plugins.
c) noConflict mode as t3jQuery: why not use the default &quot;jQuery&quot; here? 
c2) noConflict mode should be switchable
d) missing debug version
e) I would not actually load jQuery with this patch already as we should do that bit by bit while replacing prototype

So all in all I think we should first have a clear API for the mentioned problems/features (different versions, different plugins, plugin loader and registry) and create a patch for that and then start with replacing prototype/scriptaculous step by step.
|Patch Set 1:

sorry bad formatting. hopefully better:

|Patch Set 10:

Looks better already, but I still have a point, I'd want to discuss:

Why do we need to add hardcoded CDN urls to the API? If you want your jquery included from a cdn then give the whole URL to the API. 
It should be no option for the backend anyway, as we can't ship a TYPO3 that needs an outside connection and extension developers should definitely not depend on one either. 

So I'd really prefer if we could kick the cdn/external inclusion from the API and just make that possible via TypoScript or an API (something like provideJquery($version, $url);).

I'd really like to see a discussion about this, as I want to have the best possible API for JS inclusion this time around...

Sorry Philipp, but I don't want &quot;dev specific&quot; code in the TYPO3 core at all, especially not code that is located in the bootstrap and therefore executed every time. 

What would probably be an alternative: Let the install tool (and only that ;)) check if extbase and fluid exist - as they are required now, they should exist like typo3temp et al. So maybe we can introduce this check there.

Took care of the occurences of tslib/media.

Markus: yes, they were already different in 4.6.9 but should never have been, and as far as I checked, the media folder in tslib was the &quot;master&quot; folder - and the changes were mostly cgl and &quot;beautifying&quot;. Did you find any &quot;real&quot; changes there? I again compared the two folders when making this patch, and from my side it looks ok.

Tested the functionality of the fileicons with the &quot;uploads&quot; content element and with the following typoscript:
3 = TEXT
3 {

      value = title.png
      filelink {
             path = fileadmin/_migrated/pics/
             icon = 1

As far as I can see we should not remove the replacement as TYPO3 core still allows the media/ folder as valid place for storing scripts and media files (see t3lib_tstemplate for example) - if someone is still using that directory for file inclusion this patch will break paths if absRefPrefix is used.

We should deprecate the inclusion of files in the media folder first.

Please add a unit test for this case (the function already has quite some tests, just add one more ;))

And a thought: From the look of your code you now return false even if the object has a string representation (that could possibly be interpreted as integer), I'd rather check if toString works and only return false if it does not.

AFAICS the non-working modules are caused by TYPO3 trying to load http://localhost/typo3dev/typo3/blank in my case, because TYPO3.Backend.ContentContainer.getUrl() returns about:blank (which it probably shouldn't).

I don't know enough about the card layout, but I'm guessing TYPO3.Backend.ContentContainer.getUrl() should contain the active card url and not about:blank. If anybody can give me a hint what I can debug, I'll be happy to help.

|Patch Set 3: Fails

I had serious problems with the patch. I created a simple form with radio buttons, multi select drop down and a text field. Problem is: For me neither the preview nor the submit functions are working and when I go back from the preview I only get the message &quot;Array&quot;.

|Patch Set 4: (47 inline comments)

first part of review by reading. stay tuned for part 2 ;) see comments.
|Patch Set 4: (48 inline comments)

Some general remarks:
- use exceptions instead of casting everything to the expected value
- add doccomments where you throw exceptions
- readjust doccomments (quite some are outdated / wrong)
- no @return for constructors, please
- don't depend on third party captchas, give third party devs an API to register their captcha instead
- use TYPO3 naming conventions for classes
- remove demo sections from the manual, fill out the cover page and update the index
- missing possibilities to add own implementations for elements (afaics)
- don't just call parent::_construct 
- avoid code duplication (!)


I really like the new FORM object however there are some things that prevent me from giving a positive vote here. Most of the things I commented are nitpicks or no-brainers but there are some things I'd love to see fixed before we merge this:
- Checking for third-party captcha extensions the way it's done here in various places is a no-go for me. 
- There is a lot of duplicated code - in places nearly whole classes have been duplicated - I fear this duplication will stay as no-one will get rid of it later
- Maybe I missed that part but: For me some kind of API for extensions is missing in general. How do I write my own validators, my own filters? I suppose this is possible somehow but I did not find that part in the manual nor in the code (TS??).

I did not review the JS part as I'm simply not competent enough for that ;)

And:
THANKS for this feature, Patrick. I think this will really be great and I'll certainly buy you a beer for it :-)

I like the patch and it works as promised. As for the parameters: as long as shortcuts can't have additional params the patch is fine as is. If somebody finally ;) implements shortcuts with parameters we have to take care of them here, too, but until then it's ok this way.

@Chris: The way it's implemented now is better than it was before. If you see a still better way to do it, just create a patch for it so we can implement an even better solution. I don't see a problem with incremental improvements at all.

I just removed the comments about securing the input and changed &quot;saving&quot; to &quot;securing&quot; in the commit message. I will add the hint about securing in the documentation (it does not make much sense to comment this in the code as most people won't ever have a look at the code when using TypoScript).

(I'm additionally directly submitting as these are non-functional changes and Joey already gave his +1).

I only have one concern with this change. Before the table names were like cachingframework_tx_extbase_cache_object ... these tables will still be around after this patch, as we don't delete them anywhere and the install tool compare ignores them because of the cachingframework prefix. That's not really a problem, just a bit ugly as these tables will probably be around forever. Perhaps drop them with an upgrade wizard?)

This patch fails, problem is the following:

Workspaces hooks itself to the processCmdmap function which is also called when clearing the cache. Workspaces calls $GLOBALS['typo3CacheManager']-&gt;getCache('workspaces_cache'); in that hook which fails as - it seems - flush() has not been called

I'm not really sure if we should do this... as it kills tt_news. I mean, yes modern plugins register themselves but breaking tt_news is a no-go for me as it's widely used. If we had a workaround there I'd be all for it.
|Patch Set 2: Verified

Xavier: ok, then let's do it now -- could you maybe contact the people responsible for the extensions in question so they 
are at least warned?

Markus: I'd remove it from the old templates, too - these templates provide a compatibility rendering and can be used with new TYPO3 versions to make them render like old versions did -- but there is no point in having the extension inclusion parts in there if they don't work anymore because the templates are missing.

|Patch Set 40: Code-Review+2 Verified+2

Rough but rounded edges, but working.
|Patch Set 7: Code-Review+1

If the core desperately needs the image sizes (as is stated in the comment) then - as far as I understand - that is also the case when using remote storages. 

Uploading an image to remote storage and directly using it would always result in the bug as described here (no matter if there was a cron extracting the information a minute later), so from that point of view the solution here is correct.

Is there another way to solve that without directly extracting the meta data?

Hello,

thank you for your patch, I have some questions about it.

The forge comments indicate that it might not only be youtube but every video provider with iframe support  - I have no experience in this area, is that something that should be taken into account with this patch?

Adding the iframe tags hardcoded looks wrong to me (what if for some reason I wanted frameborder to be 1?) - maybe make this configurable via TypoScript?

What do you think?
|Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

In my opinion we should not add that option but when you install on galera you should take care of changing those tables that try to force myIsam - especially in light of for example the indexed_search fulltext thing, where I would want a user to acknowledge the engine change as that also has behavioral implications.

|Patch Set 8:

Some remarks (from testing in Chrome):
&gt; From the TYPO3 backend the install tool looks strange (as the background of the box is the same as the background of the page).
&gt; Configuration presets: if all are closed, the copyright text overlaps the menu bar and buttons.
&gt; Configuration presets: if I open one preset and scroll down the copyright text gets between the activate and toggle buttons and the presets (same problem with all longer pages)
&gt; Write Configuration/Activate and toggle all seem to have no spacing (or is this by design?)
&gt; Executing the upgrade wizard shows error &quot;$className must be non empty string&quot; (might be unrelated to this patch set)
&gt; System environment: PHP info has no toggle arrow and no cursor:pointer 
&gt; Test setup: the command text areas are way too small 

As I don't know whether this patchset is laying groundwork or should be complete I won't vote ;)
|Patch Set 5:

if you change the interface it's breaking, because everybody implementing that will get errors.
|Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

For me it's simple: an interface is public and an interface change is breaking. Offering an interface means people should be able to use it. I agree that in this case the chance somebody actually does is very small, but still, let's just document it.

it looks hacky but actually I think it's a fast and ok solution to get media in pages working again. In general we should probably think about content relations to pages, as we will get the same problem there again.

Create a backend user and group that has a valid db and file mount and give that group access (via access lists) to all tables and fields.

Go to the access module and allow editing of the page and disallow editing of any page content. Then open the page properties (where you previously added media) and see an exception.

The behavior is easier to see in a 6.2 as in 7 you can't edit a bookmark and not assign a group.

Problem is: as long as the bookmark has no group the user could not edit the bookmark - not even his own if he wasn't admin. Editing worked only after adding a group.

In 7 I was not able to reproduce the wrong behavior as groups are always assigned, but I tested (nothing breaks) and the code does make a lot more sense this way.

Patch works fine for removing the drag and drop stuff.

Inline Editing in the page tree (on double click) still works, as does context menu &gt; edit.

Furthermore even as an admin I don't see the edit page properties icon anymore when editlock is set.
|Patch Set 4: Verified-1

edit lock for pages is broken for admins even before this patch, so I'm going to ignore it here.

Context Menu in the page tree is now gone, but inline editing still works for a user that has no access (and results in a forbidden flash message)

|Patch Set 2: Verified-1

First results from testing:
One language no workspaces:
- Copy from default language --&gt; delete --&gt; Alert says the record has a translation that will be deleted [that does not make sense]
- Column Left has no [Translate from default] button but contains one content element (and has a copy from ...language drop down)
- Column Normal has a Translate from default but no dropdown
|Patch Set 3: Verified-1

see comments to patch set 2
|Patch Set 3:

ih, complicated. 
do the following:
- translate from default
- move to another column
- reload page module
- now use copy (only option where the translate by default button was before)
- after copying you have 2 copies, one in the column where you clicked the button, one where you moved the element to
|Patch Set 3:

- The element count is not refreshed when moving elements with drag and drop
|Patch Set 4: Verified-1

Your last changes break the feature completely as you now get an error when trying to copy from anything else than the default language.
|Patch Set 5: Verified-1

Now copying from default language creates two copies?? I don't get it, but I created a screen cast so you may see: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5sWHr_PrGE8NTZCVG95T2MxdWc/view

|Patch Set 10: Code-Review+1 Verified+1

Minor but acceptable stuff left for later:
- Count in button is only refreshed after page refresh
- When copying and translating to one language creating a copy from that language will result in two records being created, as the copy AND the translation will be copied.

I don't get which exceptions should be caught here, checkDependencies itself already catches and transforms exceptions itself, so afaics either that try catch block should be adjusted or there is a part throwing exceptions I did not find &lt;&lt; if so please point me there ;)
|Patch Set 1:

Did try to reproduce it with the - non-installed - extensions mentioned in the forge ticket, I don't get an exception. I debugged it a bit and in master at least &quot;hasDependencyErrors&quot; is true but no exception is thrown as that is caught in the dependencyCheck itself. 

The try-catch-blocks there were integrated when you implemented the bypass-dependency-check thing. If you have time, let's compare code together - just trigger me on slack.

|Patch Set 21:

@markus: will try using curl explicitly, but my point is - my current configuration works before the patch and stops working after applying it (whether it's because it is then using curl or not does not really matter, because it still means we might break running instances with the patch).
|Patch Set 21: Code-Review+2 Verified+2

ok ;) had to set cainfo for curl in php settings explicitly to get curl running for https urls. so the disclaimer for the patch is, that even if your system was using sockets before it will now automatically use curl if installed, so make sure it's running.

Actually, yes, the patch changes behaviour, but... if you added 10 empty lines before the patch, the frontend actually rendered 11... which is a bug.

I'm guessing work in progress, as RST and issue are both missing.

I dislike the use of $_ as parameter in the __construct call. I understand that this keeps compatibility on old calls, but as the last two parameters are rarely used afaics, I'd prefer removing the useless one and reordering the other parameters.

Reinhard is right, the functionality is also needed for the thumbnails in the export case - which by the way does not really work, because the thumbnail image gets uploaded to fileadmin/user_upload/_temp_/importexport/ which has an .htaccess file denying access and therefor making it impossible to display the image in the backend.

To achieve what you describe in the commit message I would probably move checkUpload back to where it was and add some logic in checkUpload (maybe checking if GP('file') isset would be enough?). What do you think?

with this change I always get the first valid config, so if I add (in the example flex form) another suggest element with a different table that only finds elements from the first one. I'm looking into it now.

yes, but that is actually valid and works. I nearly have a solution, I think, give me another hour ;)

- page translated to dansk, not translated to german
- list view before the patch: only german icons
- list view after the patch: only dansk icons (which I think is actually more correct, but &quot;someone&quot; should verify that)

@Mathias, nope, the current constraint does not make sense, as it allows everything below 3.1 ... and everything above 2.7... so basically it allows nearly everything. you can check at https://semver.mwl.be/#?package=symfony%2Fconsole&amp;version=%3E%3D2.7%20%7C%20%3C3.1&amp;minimum-stability=stable

As a side note: even if the required label is missing requestUpdate saves the record - so my required field isn't required in any case (but at a guess I'd say that is form engine in general)

2: SQL error: 'Incorrect integer value: '' for column 'base' at row 1' (sys_filemounts:2)
|Uploaded patch set 3.
|Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1 Verified+1

traced the problem to DataHandler -&gt; RelationHandler -&gt; readList which basically throws away the zero if it does not find a record with that ID and just returns an empty string. The added tca options allows to set reference to non-existing IDs which is why my addition works without errors. However, that is only a workaround. 

A real solution would take longer, as figuring out what the default should be is not really possible from TCA only (as the field could also contain comma-separated values - even including table names - and string would then be correct).

+1 on reading, but how to test this? On windows, isProcessed always returns true, even if I disable all image processing and no thumbnails are generated...
|Patch Set 1:

Yes of course I can let it fail by manipulating the code. But my question is actually what do we expect? If I disable image processing completely, do you still expect processing to be true or false? Because even though no thumbnails are generated processed returns true. Which seems counter intuitive and from what I understood from your commit message plain wrong.

I have strict mode enabled, which enforces the sql standard. In this case: https://mariadb.com/kb/en/sql-99/rules-for-grouping-columns/ 

Or in other words: every column that is selected also has to appear in the group by (an exception are functions/aggregates).
|Patch Set 2:

before the patch I get the view module and my web site (and the sql error appears in the debug console if that is enabled). After the patch I only get an exception. So yes, the SQL was wrong before but as doctrine throws a &quot;real&quot; exception, it's worse afterwards.

|Patch Set 3:

The problem the reporter of the issue had is actually related to the nested subfolder feature, because as the issue description states, he/she did not remove _processed_ but only the files and folders in it. Clearing the processed folder is probably a valid usage of the system, but I'd say deleting the whole _processed_ folder is not - as that means that you are intentionally deleting a system relevant folder without ensuring the presence of that folder afterwards. So I'd be fine with master and 7.6, but not really sure about 6.2.

Did we really get an SQL error before or didn't the function just assume offset = limit and work as if a limit was given? Therefor still delivering results? the latter would mean this actually is breaking, even though it worked by &quot;blind luck&quot; before.

as always, I don't know that much about javaScript, but the config looks good to me. Tested via command line and of course in PHPStorm. For those who don't know: PHPStorm is capable to display the tests in much the same way as the phpunit tests, but you may additionally toggle auto-test, which basically works like a watcher, but with nice test results ;)
|Patch Set 7:

I'd add an outer describe block describing the &quot;class&quot; that is being tested (for example &quot;FormEngineValidation&quot;). At the moment I can only see &quot;tests for trimExplode&quot;, but with an outer describe block we could have:
FormEngineValidation Tests
- tests for trimExplode
- tests for parseInt
...

isn't this a breaking change? as if you are using shortcuts for tt_address that won't work anymore? I'd at least add a .rst file about it.

@Frans: I think it's cleaner this way, as the tables should by default only be core tables. But yes, it would be cleaner to check for table existence based on TCA - but that would be sanity checking for typoscript configuration (which could be done at a thousand places more ;)). From my point of view the patch is ok this way, as it is better than it was before.

As the analysis in the ticket states this is actually an issue not only concerning languages but datahandler handling/storing empty values therefor I'd prefer a more general solution here. I can dimly remember having the same problem with a &quot;normal&quot; select field not too long ago, but I can't actually find the issue again.

InheritanceResolverService: the functionality of getValueByPath of the core ArrayUtility is different to the one from extbase. First of all the array is not handled as reference, second the delimiter is different and has to be set in the call and last the core method throws an exception that has to be caught to simulate the old behaviour.

The setting as set in this patch changes the eol setting for all files git recognizes as text. This can be dangerous, as we have no explicit declaration of which files are binary and which aren't - so if git wrongly recognizes a file as text file it will change it which may result in broken files.
|Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1
|Patch Set 1:

I'd honestly not add anything here, as we can't really come up with an exhausting list of what is binary and what isn't and in which scenario this may or may not cause problems. While working on windows I usually configure my git per project locally, as it depends on how I'm using the project (shared folder and vagrant machine as server, IIS, apache et al). I'm not sure it's possible for us to configure this without breaking stuff somewhere. 
What exactly is the benefit here vs. the potential breakage?
|Patch Set 1:

Just talked to Benji Kott on the phone, our plan would be:
- Make .editorconfig explicit (define which files should get LF by file extension)
- Add the exact same set of file extensions to .gitattributes (so it is consistent and safe)

with this implementation the extension author has to actively activate the feature, doesn't he? that's the only drawback I see here, as I fear a lot of people won't do that (either forgetting or not knowing).

- removed pages_language_overlay from testbase fixtures
- added testbase as sysext with composer.json
- moved acceptance and functional framework and bootstrap

General question:
- Do we want to have one folder with general fixtures or one for Functional one for Acceptance? (Currently I moved them to two folders - same as it was before, but maybe it makes sense to define more general fixtures in one place)

- the namespace was actually meant to be the final namespace (but is open for discussion - but please after step 1)
- as for breaking windows installations: yes, if the patch is released as is and the core is installed with --prefer-dist it will break on windows - the split to an own package before the next release will prevent that though. So possible breakage will only occur if the following critera are all met: &quot;--prefer-dist&quot; given, windows installation, &quot;dev-master&quot; required.

I will also add some more background to the ticket (thx @Nicole for the hint)

how about we create a new formhandler acceptance test helper method for date fields that takes the string and calls DateTime::createFromFormat(DateTime::ATOM) (which corresponds to ISO-8601, see docs) and compares after that?

As the core has more than one method actually writing to the sys_log table with _very_ inconsistent usage of details_nr there is currently no way to cleanly identify similar errors. That would only be possible after a massive refactoring of this area of TYPO3.
I agree that the naming is kind of confusing, I also wondered why closely the same looking errors were not deleted when pressing the button.
I'd propose to change it to something more clear like
- Delete errors with same message
- Delete all errors like this
-... ?

yes, please support mssql without identy insert - that is a pretty dirty workaround and expensive.

as we do a drop table before and then insert it should not be a problem (as the drop resets auto_increment and therefor 1 could only be some line inserted between execution of the create and insert statement in that file, which is highly unlikely.)

I'm pretty sure import/export forces them, too.

I'm on it.
|Patch Set 1:

- the constant is only undefined in unit tests, in functional and acceptance tests it's already set by setUpBasicTypo3Bootstrap (defineLoggingAndExceptionConstants)
- I'm not getting why we should need to set this generally for all unit tests (it's used nine times in the core in places where I'd say if you have a unit test touching these then you should take care of the constant there)
|Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1 Verified+1

I'm fine with this variant, perspectively we should remove that constant and use sensible logging

merged as no-brainer.

- added dependencies to necessary core parts (core and fluid)
- renamed the vendor

For the classAlias thing: From my tests I'd then loose the deprecation info in my IDE, so I'd rather prefer to leave the compat classes there.

|Patch Set 4:

Had an error when trying to post my last comment, so here I try again.

General user story:

As an editor I want to preview a page that has a start time set (without having to unset start time and disable the page instead) and not get a 404 error when clicking view in the backend.

Situation before:
- previewing for an editor was not possible, ends up in a 404 not found when clicking view icon (so even if he had an admin panel [which an editor should not have, it's called admin panel for a reason] - he can't use it, as the 404 handling kicks in first)
- fe_groups restriction and hidden restriction are ignored when showHiddenPages/Records is set, times aren't 
- just setting sim-time doesn't cut it, as then we'd need to figure out which of the multiple start and end times should be taken (page // records having different ones for example).

Situation now:
- show hidden takes into account all 4 cases of why a record can be hidden (disabled, timed, access restricted) and is consistent

Security:
- Please explain how to reproduce the security risk you see, as it is unclear to me.
|Patch Set 4:

I basically understand your concerns, and started an alternative implementation (incl. revert of this one) in https://review.typo3.org/#/c/52098/ 

But I need your help (anyone's really ;)): I can't figure out how to get the context menu and save and view buttons to add the parameters - some JS magic is used there, and I can't find where the links are built. All php generated links should be consistent now. Please take a look if that's more in line in how you'd like to see this implemented.

please note my comment on patch set 6 - I don't really like changing the behavior of the method as that changes behaviour extensions may rely on (see BU::viewOnClick hooks) - we are now adding params that cannot be influenced by the hooks anymore :(
|Patch Set 10: Code-Review+1

Only thing would be fetching the info twice, but I think in backend context that is &quot;ok&quot;, so I'm fine with it now, thanks!
|Patch Set 10:

On my way out of the office, but one last thing to check (will do tomorrow if no-one has time for it first): can we remove it from viewmodule now that it's part of viewOnClick?
|Patch Set 10: Verified+1

ok, we can leave the view module as is, because it builds the link completely on its own - should be refactored but not as part of this patch.

Finally found a way to reproduce this:

- bootstrap package --&gt; accordion element --&gt; added allowLangSync... for both tt_content.accordionitem and accordionitem.media (or really any other Element &lt;IRRE with allowedSync&gt; Element &lt;IRRE with allowedSync&gt; Element constellation I guess - 2lvl IRRE is important)
- Create the root element but no children
- Translate the root element
- Add child and grandchild simultanously to root element and save
--&gt; Exception

Sadly, the patch does not fix it - instead after the patch the grandchildren get attached to the localization (and only the localization). So:
- You create root element.
- You create translation.
- You create child and grandchild.
- You press save and close.
- You open translation and you are happy for a second because all looks well.
- You open original root element again and open the child. Now you are sad because your grandchild has moved on to the live only in the localization :'(
|Patch Set 11: Verified-1

Test case from previous comment (child, grandchild new, translation parent already exists) works now, but:

Test case (Same configuration with bootstrap accordion as before):

- Create an accordion with one child (does not even need a grand child)
- Translate that element
- Translation has no child

further testing (next steps I did in that case:)
- re-open default language element, edit child record, save
- re-open translation: now there _is_ a child record, but curiously it does not have translation markers (the &quot;translate to:&quot; stuff), but the copy annotation (so now it's (copy 1))

Works, but for me at the moment only while editing within the page properties and not when adding the title via pagetree but this may be the case due to pagetree problems.

@Wouter: Thank you for your review. I fixed all &quot;makeInstance&quot; and &quot;objectManger-&gt;get / -&gt; create&quot; lines and the &quot;empty&quot; thing.

@Christian: Hope someone will find the time to review it, because the old language module looks a bit crappy in the new - clean - Backend. Most of the stuff in the list is just moving the classes and resources from old &quot;lang&quot; extension to the new one. All old class paths are defined in the migration file and the translation stuff is still working.
|Uploaded patch set 5.
|Patch Set 5:

@Wouter: Thank you for the review. I've corrected all commented lines.

The idea for the new language extension was born at the code sprint in Hamburg last week. The &quot;lang&quot; extension is very old and historically grown. But it doesn't contain a good code base for future developments. Because that I decided to rewrite the PHP and JS parts and to cleanup the interface to fit into new Backend design. The code is based on the old &quot;lang&quot; extension but the controller is completely rewritten and some unnecessary code was removed from the other classes.

The old &quot;lang&quot; extension should be removed in the next releases. But it needs a bit work to do that, because all internal language files are stored in the root directory of the lang extension and are mostly referenced with a hardcoded path.

I saw the broken system problem in the past an wrote some words in the related forge ticket. But with the last commit I added an update wizard for the install tool to fix this.

The update of a language takes a long time. That is a problem since years before. But with the previous rewrite of the lang extension, I had improved this a bit. Now I've done this again and improved the speed up to two times. This is done with removing the check if an translation file is available on server. If the file will be not available when fetching, it will anyway fail and so I only try to fetch the file now. The big problem is not the Extbase dispatching, it need much time to request the server, wait for an answer and download the translation zip file. If we can improve that, a language update will be faster.

|Patch Set 7:

@Benjamin: This is not a good idea because the extension key &quot;lang&quot; is not a good name for a system extension. Compare this with the coding guidelines. A developer has to use all variables with speaking names and without abbreviations. Why should it not also apply to extension keys? I was and am willing to take this effort to me and I hope the reviewers and mergers do the same.

Currently I'm working on a patch (#63104) to move all the language files from the root directory (!) of the old lang extension to the correct resources path in the new language extension. That looks much more clean and intuitive.
|Patch Set 9:

@Helmut: My name is &quot;Kai&quot; not &quot;Kay&quot; ;-)

Probably you have not noticed, that I have already considered the complete migration stuff in this patch. There is also a second patch that completely moves all language files to the correct location and updates the references. Since this is absolutely necessary, the new extension name makes no difference in this process. Yes this is a larger patch, but it is pretty complete. And small corrections can be made in subsequent patches. So please take the patch just as it is before it goes down in long discussions. The following is an overview of what has been done:

# 62983:
- Create new extension &quot;language&quot;
- Move and clean code
- Create the new module
- Mapping of the old class names in the migration script
- Added an Upgrade Wizard step for the correction of PackageStates.php

# 63104:
- Move all language files into the new Extension
- Move all images into the new extension
- Delete the old &quot;lang&quot; extension
- Update all references in the entire core
- Providing a fallback for old language file references

As you can see, the &quot;good migration path&quot; is already included in the two patches. For both the old classes, as well as the old language files remain valid and can be corrected in the community extensions by and by, if necessary.

The inline comments from Philipp Gampe and Andreas Wolf are taken in Patchset 13. I also added a condition around the task definition in ext_localconf.php because Windows users shouldn't see a task which they can't use because it only throws an exception when calling.

The problem can be reproduced by selecting &quot;sys_log&quot; and removing the number of days. Then check and afterwards uncheck the checkbox for all tables. Now the number of days field is disabled and you can't set a value.
|Uploaded patch set 4.
|Patch Set 4:

&quot;For me this also happens if I select the sys_log table, enter 0 and save. If I then open again, I can't change the number of days any more. This also happens after your patch.&quot;
-&gt; This is now fixed

&quot;However with you patch, I am able to check all tables checkbox and after uncheck, the value is 180 again.&quot;
-&gt; I can't reproduce this problem (maybe cache?)

&quot;For cache_pages I am never able to change the value.&quot;
-&gt; That's true because there is no 'expirePeriod' defined for this table in ext_localconf.php
|Patch Set 4: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I tested this with the fluid text &amp; media element. i placed the select viewhelper above the div containing the bodytext. After installing your patch it doesn't contain an empty option tag anymore but also doesn't render any other HTML placed after the viewhelper. The select viewhelper just surrounds the content of the text &amp; media element and the content of a header element, which was was placed after the text &amp; media element in the backend.

not too sure about the warning in the top of the module body, because you can't really suppress the warning and if for some reason you don't want to delete these elements or move them yet, it could be annoying. Or is it meant to kind of force the user to deal with it?

Would it be too much work to give the column a label? if you have quiet many content elements, have to scroll down and you don't see the warning anymore, a label 'unused or unallocated elements' would be nice.

The grey (send back) button wants to sent to the wrong stage in some situations.
I got the wrong button in the following situation:
The stages are the following: Editing, Review, Check by law, Ready to publish.
I have three element changes on one page, one element in &quot;Check by law&quot; and two in &quot;Review&quot; stage. Now the green (sent to next) button shows &quot;Send to stage Check by law&quot; which is correct as the lowest changes are in &quot;Review&quot; stage. But the grey (send back) button shows &quot;Send to stage Editing&quot; which is wrong, as the highest element is in stage &quot;Check by law&quot; so the next previous stage would be &quot;Review&quot;.

As described: TYPO3 4.5 works only with W3C formatted strings and timestamps.

I checked the localconf.php. The extension gridelements was always at the end of the list - even in TYPO3 4.7! I put it before flux and fed and deleted all temp_* files in typo3conf. It did not change anything.
On top of that: After creating (save &amp; close icon) the new CE, the page doesn't get a reload. It is blank then (The main part that contained the wizard. The page tree and menus are still visible).

Currently I am uploading my TYPO3 4.6.4 configuration. In the file (tar.gz) is a fedtemplate2.sql - that is a dump from my testdatabase. Hope it is reproduceable then.

Thanks for the comments in TceMain.php. Helps a lot. Drag &amp; drop works for me now in any test cases. Thanks for your patience with me and thanks for the great patch!
