== Dumping data for table JOINED_TABLE

|Please use the \e command to introduce terms in the future: \e {soft dependency}
|Hum, hum, now that I actually built this, the tool tips don't seem to appear.
|A \section1 needs to use book style caps: &quot;Extensions to JavaScript Built-in Objects&quot;
|The {directory -&gt; topic} notation is not used in the documentation, so I don't know what you mean by it. Please explain.

Add a period in the end.
|What does &quot;supporting a topic&quot; mean? Is &quot;topic&quot; defined somewhere?
|Add the definite article: &quot;…the TopicCache subclass…&quot;
|&quot;…the path to the file …&quot;

What does &quot;for \a repository&quot; refer to?
|Use English instead of Latin. &quot;e.g.&quot; should be &quot;For example&quot;
|&quot;…the current topic…&quot;
|&quot;…the topic for the repository…&quot;
|Would make sense to also change this to &quot;Manage…&quot;.
|How about this?
|Did you intentionally commit this change?
|I'm wondering whether this should be &quot;introducer&quot;, but as it is code, it probably should not be &quot;fixed&quot;.
|http://www.thefreedictionary.com/reopen
|In Qt Creator, there should be a period after the tooltip, but I don't think the rule has been enforced in the other tools.
|Is all this needed if there is no actual string?
|I think we should integrate this information in the docs. Maybe here: http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qt5-release/plugins-howto.html. I actually have a version I thought could go in the iOS docs, but that I could make more generic and move to the core docs.
|Not necessarily, that one comes from the style sheet. Although I like to place empty lines between \li commands to make it clearer for myself what all belongs in a list item.
|But the plugin names are used as values of the qmake QTPLUGINS variable, and the qmake variable reference should list the available values or explain how users can figure them out. I don't see why the qmake-specific identifiers should not be in the qmake Manual. It is good to explain things where users need them, but detailed information should be in the reference of the tool to make it easier to find.
|I would actually like to move the whole table to the qmake Manual, because it is becoming really big. What do you think?
|Is there a reason why only some plugins are listed in this table, or has it just not been maintained? I have a patch for adding loads of them.
|Could these sections be replaced with the link list above?
|If you want these docs to be generated, you should use the QDoc markup: /*!

Also, you don't need the \brief command for function descriptions.
|Use the macro \QC for the product name.
|Instead of @param, use \a origData, or QDoc will complain that the argument is not documented. Write full sentences that describe the arguments. For example:

&quot;Compares \a newData against \a origData, and returns \c true if \a newData is a better match. Otherwise returns \c false.&quot;
|This needs to be /*!
|The idea is to create sentences that discuss the arguments in relation to each other. Did you not like my version? It was similar to the documentation for the next function.
|/*!
|Did you rename this to &quot;Add New Expression Evaluator...&quot; here? Does this now open a submenu or a dialog, as you added the three dots?
|Should be &quot;cannot be built&quot; or &quot;could not be built&quot;
|&quot;cannot&quot;
|&quot;available on&quot;
|Maybe I'm wrong, but I think you need to remove the tr() command from here, or the code will be visible in Qt Linguist as translatable text.
|I thought you wanted to change these to QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP?
|OK, based on the example, it looks like I was wrong and you can do this. I've just never seen this before.
|QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP?
|Because these are tooltips for icons, you can treat them as command names &quot;Collapse Category&quot; : &quot;Expand Category&quot; (use book style capitalization and remove punctuation.
|Should this be OpenLinkInNewPage or something like that?
|Please rewrite: &quot;Use the value \c qt4project to add Qt 4 specific pages.
|I think Bill meant that you should add the preposition here: 'step, in the \gui...&quot;
He wrote to add 'under', but the convention in the Manual is to write 'in a field'.
|Remove the preposition 'under': 'The \gui {Local File Path} field displays...'
|It is actually the text inside the field that is red, but I suppose this is also understandable.
|Use the article 'an', because 'Embedded' starts with a vovel: 'an \gui {Embedded Linux} target...'
|Add the preposition 'to and the definitive article': '... shall be added to the ...'
|Replace 'in' with 'into' and add the definite article: 'into the project .pro file.'
|Replace 'into' with 'in' and add a full stop (.) to the end of the sentense: '...in the project file.'
|Add the article: '...deployment steps for the target...'

Add formatting for the remove button: '...by using the \gui {Remove Item} button.
|Add the article: '...deployment steps for the target...'
|Add formatting for button names and use the names in the tooltips: '\gui {Move Down} and \gui {Move Up} buttons.'
|Add the article: '...deployment steps for the target...'
|The convention in the Manual is to use the term 'menu' for all menus: '\gui {Add Deploy Step} menu.'
|To follow the usual style in the Manual, I would rephrase: &quot;To enable the plugin, select [...]. To use the plugin, restart \QC.&quot;
|Using comma in a list before 'and' is grammatically correct if the list has more than two items: go, select, and click. Both of these are correct, we just need to pick one style.
|Use the fixnavi script to fix the reference to the previous page: nmake fixnavi
|Using fixnavi also fixes this reference.
|leave the \nextpage tag and use fixnavi to automatically insert the correct value for it.
|Using fixnavi inserts the correct value here. Do not remove the tag.
|Do not remove the tag.
|You also need to remove the 6th item on each row, or the table will be broken. But, it would be better to leave Symbian here and just replace 'yes' with 'no' on all rows, and to add a note saying that Symbian support has been discontinued and that Symbian developers should use Qt Creator  2.4.
|Is this option needed for other target platforms, besides Symbian, or should we remove it?
|Do not remove the tag.
|Or &quot;Development Tools&quot;
|This sounds like there is no umbrella term for the content placed in this section (like it was not planned in any way). We could call this section &quot;Application Development&quot; and rename &quot;Application Development&quot; below as &quot;Development Tools&quot;.
|&quot;Development Tools&quot;
|You have the Code Samples title here twice. Maybe change this one to &quot;Qt Code Samples&quot; or &quot;C++ Code Samples&quot;, or whatever the distinction is from &quot;Qt Quick Code Samples&quot;.
|This could actually be called &quot;Application Development&quot; and first subtopic could be called &quot;Development Tools&quot;.
|In Qt Creator  2.6, you can use the code editor to develop Qt Quick 2 apps. The team is working on making Qt Quick Designer (visual editor) support Qt Quick 2, but it won't make it to 2.6.
|It would be good to keep these in alphabetic order to make finding them easier, so this should go after qtdbus.
|Could you also add qtlinguist in the correct place?
|This does not really improve the message, because both alternatives are grammatically correct. Actually, I've worked with editors who prefer the &quot;to edit&quot; form to the &quot;ing&quot; form.
|No, there is no difference in meaning in these two versions.
|I suppose just &quot;global&quot; would be fine if there is only one set, but this did not sound wrong to me
|I don't see a big difference here. &quot;Those&quot; points to particular instances of declarations (declarations a and b), whereas &quot;such&quot; would mean more &quot;declarations like these&quot;
|You need to embed the list items (\li) in the \list \endlist command for the list to be displayed correctly.
|Maybe you should fix these as a separate commit, but &quot;Mer SDK&quot; should be two words separated by a space, I think. &quot;SDK&quot; should be all caps.
|&quot;SDK&quot;
|&quot;SDK&quot;
|As they appear in a view, I think they should be translated, but I can see how it would be a problem for Qt Support, as the messages don't have numerical codes.
|&quot;Configuration&quot; and &quot;Setup&quot; mean the same thing, so one is enough. Could also be &quot;Configure New Mer Device&quot; or &quot;Set up New Mer Device&quot;.
|You could also put the verb first: &quot;Check  Device Status&quot;
|You could also put the verb first: &quot;Check Existing Keys&quot;
|You could also put the verb first: &quot;Create Keys&quot;
|&quot;Mer SDK&quot;
|&quot;SDK&quot;
|SDK
|Use sentence style capitalization for labels: &quot;Add files matching pattern:&quot;


Please read the user interface text guidelines here: http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-ui-text.html


Please ask if you are not sure about how to capitalize a particular string.
|Use sentence style capitalization for labels: &quot;Skip files matching pattern:&quot;
|If this is a dialog title, you should use book style capitalization: &quot;Restart Required&quot;, so not that you are touching this anyway, maybe you could fix it? :)
|I think you can only use the docUrl tag to point to an HTML file in a Qt help file (.qch). For example: docUrl=&quot;qthelp://org.qt-project.qtc
reator/doc/creator-app-tutorial-bb10.html&quot;

You would need to create a .qdoc file in qt-creator/doc/src/qnx (for example, creator-app-tutorial-bb10.qdoc) with the &quot;\page creator-app-tutorial-bb10.html&quot; command. Also, you would need to add the topic to the TOC in doc/src/qtcreator.qdoc and to the Tutorials topic to be able to access it also from the Qt Creator Manual contents.

For more information, see:  http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-documentation.html
|The verbs in both clauses need to use either passive or active tense: &quot;If so, it processes the stream arguments and calls...&quot; or &quot;If so, the stream arguments are processed and the \c{start()} function  [...] is called.
|A verb seems to be missing here. What is done to the end() function?
|You need to start the brief for a C++ class with a set phrase, or QDoc should complain: &quot;The QTracer class is an ...&quot;
|&quot;The QTraceGuard class facilitates ...&quot;
|What does &quot;it&quot; refer to here? In any case, the verb should be in third person plural: &quot;it checks&quot;, &quot;them macro checks&quot;, or something like that.
|Do not use the indefinite article &quot;a&quot; with plural: &quot;...of \c QTraceGuard objects...&quot; or  &quot;...of a \c QTraceGuard object...&quot;

As this is a new paragraph, it would be better to say what &quot;it&quot; refers to: &quot;the macro checks...&quot;?
|&quot;a guard&quot;
|Fix typo: &quot;Destroys&quot;
|If the search scope is the working directory, this could also be &quot;Files in Working Directory&quot;.
|You could just list &quot;iOS&quot; above, with a &quot;magic link&quot; :). The technical details would then be at the end of the link.
|As you are changing this, you could write &quot;Git&quot; with a capital letter.
|Add a period to the end of the message.
|Use standard punctuation in messages. That is, add a period in the end.
|Shouldn't the new section be in the &quot;User Interface Guidelines&quot;?
|Use book-style capitalization: &quot;User Visible Strings&quot;
|Replace the comma with a full stop.
|&quot;URL&quot;
|Add the following sections (for an example, see:http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qt5-release/qtwinextras-index.html)

- Getting Started (describes how to include the module and how to link to it)

- Articles and Guides (contains a link to an Overview topic that describes the use cases for the plugins and connection classes)

- Examples (contains a link to a Qt Debug Support example documentation)

- API Reference (contains links to C++ classes and QML types in the module)
|The other title seems to use book style caps: &quot;Building Documentation&quot;
|This would read better as: To build Qt Creator documentation, run:
|Sorry for the late review, as it looks like these need to go into master now. Even though I don't see a problem with &quot;self-defined&quot;, especially, if it is used by the tools themselves, we should now keep &quot;customized&quot;, as it got into 3.1.
|You don't need to instruct users to click buttons in tooltips. If this is an icon button, write: &quot;Undock View&quot;
|&quot;successfully&quot;
|Why is it here twice, and where is it used in the dialog in the second case? If it is a dialog title, it should be capitalized, if it is a label or informative text, it should not.
|OK, then it needs to change, but in master, I think. I don't think we're supposed to change the strings for patch releases.
|Should this really be translatable?
|tr(?
|Add a full stop to the end of the description.
|Add full stop.
|Not sure about the punctuation for these. If they are labels, no punctuation is needed in the end, but if they are informative text, tooltips, or descriptions, then add a full stop.
|&quot;qmake&quot; is not written with a capital initial letter anywhere else. In other messages, you write &quot;configured&quot; instead of &quot;set up&quot;.
|&quot;set&quot; is better than &quot;set up&quot; if were are talking about a field. If you mean &quot;configured&quot;, use it for consistency with the other messages.
|Write &quot;kit&quot; in lower case.
|&quot;kit&quot;
|Write &quot;kit&quot; in lower case.
|If this is a message box title, you need to use book-style capitalization: &quot;Import Failed&quot;
|Use book-style capitalization for push buttons: &quot;Run CMake Editor&quot;
|If the field shows an example path or there is a Browse button, then it is OK, but maybe this could be &quot;CMake editor:&quot;, as before, or &quot;CMake editor executable:&quot;. (If that is what it is.)
|Are these changes intentional? Sometimes, the tools make these changes and they should not be pushed.
|You could also use tooltips for the text inside brackets. Or, if the users are more likely to understand &quot;BlackBerry ID token password&quot;, why not just use that instead of &quot;CSK password&quot;?
|See above.
|&quot;project file&quot; should probably be two words. The capitalization an punctuation depend on the role of the text in the UI. If this is a function or title, it should be &quot;Parsing Project File&quot;. If it is a message or tooltip, it should be &quot;Parsing project file.&quot;
|For the docs to be generated, they need to start with: /*!
|For consistency, remove the \brief command.
|Yes, that would be better.
|s/comma/commas
|&quot;the component tree&quot;
|&quot;listed in&quot;
|This should be &quot;an application&quot;. Write &quot;application&quot; in lower case.
|The UI text guidelines dictate that you should add a period to the end of a message:http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-ui-text.html
|Add a full stop.
|Add a full stop.
|Add a comma after &quot;installation&quot;.
|Please use the standard phrase &quot;For more information, see ...&quot;

Also, use correct capitalization in the link, even though QDoc create the link correctly.
|See above.
|We've been switching from placing all topics into one doc file to adding new topics as separate files. Please move the whole topic to a new file. You could give it the file name &quot;installerfw-offline-updates.qdoc&quot;, for example. That way, you can also add your own copyright and contact information to the license header, because this is your text :).
|&quot;Specify settings&quot; would sound better than &quot;Set settings&quot;.
|s/a offline/an offline
|Add a comma after &quot;installation&quot;.
|Add a comma after &quot;quantifiers&quot;.
|Add a comma after &quot;versions&quot;.
|Use \e for emphasis, instead of quotation marks: \e downgrade
|s/ButHowever, 


Use \e instead of quotes: \e {No updates available.}


Add a comma after &quot;case&quot;.
|Remove &quot;in the first place&quot;, because it does not really fit here.
|Use &quot;or&quot; instead of a slash (/).
|Add a comma after &quot;Otherwise&quot;.
|&quot;Key-value pairs&quot;
|Add a comma after &quot;binary&quot;.
|Add a comma after &quot;public&quot;.
|Start with &quot;This can be difficult&quot;
|Why are &quot;newer&quot; and &quot;older&quot; in quotes?
|Add a comma after &quot;problem&quot;.
|Use the \c command to format values: \c 0...
|&quot;a newer&quot;
|s/Prohibit/Prohibiting
|move the rest of the sentence here: &quot;...use the following values to prohibit ...:&quot;


And use a colon in the end.
|&quot;the product on the target system.&quot;
|s/increase/increasing
|&quot;the target system&quot;
|Add a comma after &quot;enabled&quot;.
|Add a comma after &quot;system&quot;.

&quot;highest&quot; &gt; &quot;lower&quot;
|s/components/component's
|Add a comma after &quot;script&quot;.
|The \sa command prints the reference at the end of the section. To have the reference displayed here, use: &quot;For more information, see \l{...&quot;
|s/if/whether
|Add a comma after &quot;migration&quot;.
|The Qt doc writing guidelines say to use English instead of Latin. I'm not sure how &quot;for example&quot; (e.g.) fits here, anyway. Maybe, &quot;Instead, include the version directly in the application name.&quot;
|&quot;For more information, see...&quot;
|See above. If you want the link here, you should use \l instead of \c.
|s/commandline/command line
|Do not use exclamation marks; use a full stop instead.

s\enabe\enable


Add a comma after &quot;tests&quot; and a full stop in the end.
|Are these error messages useful for Qt Creator users? They seem to refer to code, not UI elements or anything that the user could fix.
|Would &quot;Run&quot; be enough if a test is selected and this is a context menu item?
|This breaks automatic linking to class documentation. Please remove all \c commands that point to classes.
|Do not add line breaks between lines (columns) in tables.
|It looks to me like there is something wrong with the indentation here.
|The bracket pairs can be on different lines.
|No need to add spaces between lines in a row.
|Looks like there should be enough space for the text within brackets on one line.
|Wouldn't there be space for \c &quot;Text&quot; here?
|Needs indentation.
|Have users asked about this or found this misleading? How about making this more wizard-like:

Project name: -&gt; Enter a name for the imported project:

Location: -&gt; Enter the path to import the files from:
|The convention expected by QDoc in class briefs is: The xxx class yyy.

&quot;The SortedTimelineModel class provides a sorted model for timeline data.&quot;
|The Qt writing style states not to use contractions: &quot;is not&quot;
|When you start with an &quot;if&quot; clause, add a comma between the clause and the following clause: &quot;...is found, it ...&quot;

Check this everywhere.
|&quot;Device&quot;
|Because it was sitting here with no clear connection to the text. I could not even find all the terms in the text with Find. Your text for &quot;Device independent pixels&quot; is now on lines 67 through 69.
|Use the \note command: 

\note The order of ...
|can't -&gt; cannot
|Adding a tooltip is a good idea.
|The suggested name seems unclear to me, too. What happens here, actually?
|That is how we do it, though. We only add tooltips where they are needed. For example, if it is difficult to use clear and unambigious function names.
|&quot;Attach to Starting Application...&quot;

or 

&quot;Attach When Application Starts...&quot;
|Use book style capitalization for bush button labels: &quot;Apply Configuration Changes&quot;
|QDoc complains about missing documentation for the C++ userScripts property. For some reason, the C++ is also documented for this class, only:

http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-5.6/qquickwebengineprofile.html

Add the following docs for the property: 

/*!
    \property QQuickWebEngineProfile::userScripts
    \since 5.7

    \brief the collection of scripts that are injected into all pages that share
    this profile.
*/
|Replace the comma with a colon.
|Use the \brief command for the property:

\brief Icon...

http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-dev/13-qdoc-commands-topics.html#property-command
|Are you linking to the scripting doc here or to the C++? For C++, I think this needs to be &quot;Component&quot; with a capital &quot;C&quot;. And if you want to link to the scripting doc, you should use {component::addStopProcessForUpdateRequest}{component.addStopProcessForUpdateRequest} to make that clearer.

I'm adding links in another patch, so I could also add this there.
|'eating' tooltips sounds funny to me. How about 'disabled'? You can leave out the word 'either', because it sounds like you mean 'either of two controls'. How about: Tooltips should be disabled when the Control key is pressed (...) or when they are in constrained more and the Shift key is not pressed.'
|Now there are two extra lines above each other.
|It would be better to have the explained here, even though you'd have to write the text in your own words, of course. Especially, since readers won't know what the differences are.

If you do not add descriptions, you could remove the third column.
|Why do some of the values enclosed in quotes begin with a capital letter, while some do not?
|You could also start with the verb here: 'Separate the x and the y by a single space'
|I can reword this, but when you click any of the files in the list, you get detailed information about the file, such as a description, dowloads, licenses, versions, and language.
|No, we are not treating it as a proper name. in the other cases, it appears in a option list. Items in option lists use book style capitalization. Please read the guidelines here: http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-ui-text.html
|Yes, it is a preposition that is shorter than 5 characters: http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-ui-text.html
|OK, just wanted to make the point that 'terminated' does not mean there was an error, it just means something ended.
|If you mean 'ended' rather than 'ended with error', then 'terminated' would work. It does not imply that an error occurred, as 'crashed' does.
|# could be ID, but otherwise looks fine
|The following types of phrases are not usually needed in tooltips, and only make them longer than necessary: &quot;This is the&quot;. You can just as well start with the actual information: &quot;Number or...&quot;
|Replace &quot;This will show...&quot; with &quot;Displays...&quot;
|Remove &quot;this&quot;
|Grammatically incorrect. Should be either &quot;The options below..&quot; or &quot;These options...&quot;
|Remove &quot;This&quot;
|Remove &quot;this&quot;
|Remove &quot;this&quot;
|I would need to rewrite this topic completely, as it does not make much sense to go on about tool chains in a topic about compilers.
|This field should then be called &quot;Compiler&quot; and the text should be modified to discuss compilers.
|No, this is actually &quot;bundle x (=the settings  for the target device, compiler, debugger, Qt version) and y (=more) into a setting&quot;. But the readability could indeed be improved.
|As Qt Creator is a community project, we might want to point to the docs on the qt-project.org: http://qt-project.org/doc/qtcreator-2.5/creator-known-issues.html. The problem with this is that it is currently version-specific, and we would need to change it again to point to 2.6.
|This page is also available at http://qt-project.org/doc/qtcreator-2.5/
|This page is also available at http://qt-project.org/doc/qtcreator-2.5/

|This page is also available at http://qt-project.org/doc/qtcreator-2.5/
|You write &quot;Qt applications&quot;, above. Should &quot;Button Events&quot; be capitalized or not?
|Just a note for the future. If you link to http://qt-project.org/doc/qtcreator/&lt;pagename&gt;.html, the link will lead to the latest released version of the documentation. This works as long as the page is not renamed or deleted.
|I don't understand the point of this change and it does not sound necessary or grammatically correct to me. If you want two sentences, you can say: &quot;These are called \c widgets in Qt.&quot;
|qt3d should come first, if we want to keep the alphabetic order.
|qtimageformats should go after qtgui
|Apparently not.
|Should the last folder here not be the same as the value of the qhp.qmake.virtualFolder parameter?
|Shouldn't the \param index line still be here?
|Remove the dash here, too
|No dash.
|That would be better, but does not fit in the current button. Which probably means that most translations won't fit either. It would be good to redesign this UI to leave more space for wider buttons (place the push buttons below the radio buttons, maybe), but that could be done as a separate commit.
|OK, I can change this back. Earlier, we have agreed to use the format 'GDB server' though, when not describing a command that contains the process name.
|Yes, once the support for the solution in the Qt 5.1 is available in Qt Creator, we should document it.
|This support has been in place since Qt Creator 2.6, if you install Necessitas SDK.
|Is that the way it currently works, because this is documentation for Qt Creator 2.7, which is scheduled for release in the end of March (not tied in with the Android support in Qt 5.1).
|Is &quot;test.txt&quot; listed twice intentionally?
|To me, the difference between Qt QML and QtQml is not clear here.
|1) To make this more consistent with the other descriptions, rewrite: &quot;The boolean attribute \c acceptRichText sets the property QTextEdit::acceptRichText.&quot;
2) Fix typo: &quot;desireable&quot; should be &quot;desirable&quot;. However, I would rather state the reason why RTF is not desirable for code templates: &quot;...to prevent pasting of rich text with formatting, because xxx&quot;
|What is a &quot;text attribute&quot;? Or is this a copy-paste error? I use the construct &quot;The xxx attribute&quot; mostly so that I don't have to start a sentence with a lower case word. Otherwise, you could just start with the attribute name.
|Should the referenced section (Setting up FSF GDB for Mac OS) in this same file be removed, too?
|&quot;Whitespace&quot; is a non-countable and therefore it has no plural form and this should be &quot;Ignore Whitespace&quot;.
|Use sentence style capitalization for labels: &quot;Context lines:&quot;. For more information, see the UI Text Guidelines: http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-ui-text.html
|Should &quot;component&quot; be written in upper case?
|&quot;XML&quot; should be written in all upper case. If &quot;tool chains&quot; is supposed to be possessive form, it should contain an apostrophe: &quot;tool chain's&quot;. However, using the &quot;of&quot; format is preferred for inanimate objects: &quot;...from the XML file(%1) of the tool chain correctly.&quot; If this means &quot;the XML file that lists tool chains&quot; then it is correct, but a bit ambiguous, as it might also be a grammar error (and mean &quot;the XML file that specifies this tool chain&quot;).
|See above.
|See above.
|&quot;any package&quot; sounds unnatural and would sound better in plural, as just &quot;packages&quot; or &quot;any packages&quot;.
|Here, it could be &quot;a translation&quot; or &quot;translations&quot;, depending on whether there can only be one in use, or several.
|Here, &quot;any&quot; is fine.
|It just says &quot;Editor&quot; now. I suppose &quot;Editor settings view&quot; would be clearer thought.
|The official product name is &quot;Qt Quick Designer&quot;.
|If you want a numbered list, use the following command: \list 1
|The \brief command is optional and it is used inconsistently throughout the docs. Rather than adding it everywhere, I'm removing it.
|Hmm, I added the dependencies to qtdoc-project.qdocconf in https://codereview.qt-project.org/62682

Do we need both files and if not, which one should we keep?
|Well, if you must. However, keep in mind that we have a wide international audience with varying levels of English language skills.
|What do you mean by &quot;syntactic sugar&quot;?
|No, \li is the Qt 5 QDoc command and \o is the deprecated command. I'm not sure why these were wrong again in master. Maybe I did fix them in a release branch and they never got merged properly.
|We should decide, where this type of general information should go. This applies both to C++ classes and QML types, so the information is now in three different places in the documentation. This makes the documentation more difficult to maintain. I would suggest placing any information that applies to both C++ classes and QML types to the Overview, and placing the implementation details in the class and type documentation.
|The listed items are not Qt modules, though, or are they? If the port supports whole modules, you could use the module names and link to them in the docs. 

But this could be just &quot;Qt's WinRT port supports: &quot;
|These are incomplete sentences with an ellipsis in the beginning. The form of the verb depends on the part of the sentence that has been omitted.

To test whether the verb should be in third person singular form, try adding &quot;This option&quot; to the beginning of the tooltip in your mind. If the tooltip is still grammatically correct, you can add the &quot;s&quot;.

However, if you would need to add &quot;Select this option to&quot;, for the resulting tooltip to be grammatically correct, the verb should be in first person singular form (without the &quot;s&quot;).

So, here the question is: &quot;Does the option do the inserting, like a function would, or does it just specify that something else will do the inserting, when necessary?&quot;

I would keep the old version.

|I looked at the documentation for the other examples in qtbase and it does not seem to follow the latest guidelines, and I don't know why. Topi? 

For example, there is usually an \ingroup &lt;module&gt;-examples

Also, the first thing on the page (located after the \brief command) is the \image command that refers to a screenshot of the example application.

Further, add instructions for building and running the example from Qt Creator, by adding the following include file after the first text paragraph (on a separate line):

|The example name will be displayed next to the \brief in a table, so start with the verb: &quot;Shows the ...&quot;
|\e {MIME Type Browser} is a tool for ...

|This gets a bit complicated for a list, so it would be better to create a subsection called &quot;Specifying Members&quot; and put all this information there. So, in the \li command, write:

\li In the \uicontrol Members field, specify members for the class, as described in \l {Specifying Members}.

After the list, or after \section2 Adding Relations, create a new section:

\section2 Specifying Members

To specify members for the class, enter each member on a separate line using a C++ like syntax. For example, the following lines define the method \c m that is private, virtual, and constant:
    \code
	private:
	virtual int m(string a) const;
    \endcode

|I found a topic that discusses automatic type conversion between C++ and QML, and seems to indicate that QVariantList could be used as the type and automatically converted:

http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-5.8/qtqml-cppintegration-data.html#qvariantlist-and-qvariantmap-to-javascript-array-and-object
|Should there be two dots?
|Are the two dots here intentional? What do they represent?

|Done.

I wasn't sure about that, because both properties are listed in properties.qmltypes.

The markerShape property on the C++ side is also documented twice (once as an enum and once as a property). 

I've seen the same issue also in other files.
|Yes, you can now document enumerations using the &quot;\qmlproperty enumeration&quot; command and the \value command for the values.

|See above.

|Remove the URL from here, too.

|How about: &quot;Returns the reason for interrupting the download.&quot;
|See above.
|The _lgpl files are used for docs that were copied from Qt WebKit. New C++ docs should be placed in the respective .cpp file. These should go to qwebenginepage.cpp.
|QDoc is looking for this value for the \fn command: 

\fn void QWebEnginePage::loadWithPost(const QUrl &amp;url, const QMap&lt;QString, QString&gt; &amp;postData)

That is, add &quot;const&quot; before &quot;QMap&quot;
|&quot;The URL is&quot;
|Add &quot;const&quot; before QMap and &quot;QByteArray&quot; for QDoc to be able to generate the docs.
|nonempty &gt; non-empty
|Use either &quot;\c Content-Type&quot; or &quot;content type&quot;. I prefer the latter, unless you are referring to an option name, or such.

e.g. &gt; for example,

&quot;\c postData&quot; or &quot;post data&quot;
|These docs need to go to qwebengineview.cpp. See the comments for the QWebEnginePage docs, above.
|Please implement the language comments from patch set #3.
|The second &quot;url&quot; should be written in uppder case: URL
|Use \c formatting for &quot;Content-Type&quot; or write it as normal text: &quot;content type&quot;.

Use English, not Latin: e.g. &gt; for example

Use the \c command instead of the double quotes.

Use \c formatting for &quot;postData&quot; or write it as normal text: &quot;post data&quot;
|url &gt; URL
|See previous comments
|Yes, QDoc should complain about this.
|You missed some comments. Please rewrite as follows:

\note The \c {Content-Type} must be set manually (to \c {application/x-www-form-urlencoded}, for example) because \a postData is raw.
|\note The \c {Content-Type} must be set manually (to \c {application/x-www-form-urlencoded}, for example) because \a postData is raw.
|Just take the time to read the whole comment the next time, and learn the writing style rules ;).
|Here is the Qt writing rule I referred to: http://wiki.qt.io/Language_Guidelines

\a postData
|There were actually two separate comments there. Gerrit is not very useful if you need to comment on several different issues on one line.

The issue that still needs to be fixed is using &quot;e.g.&quot;. The writing rules that I linked to above recommend using English instead of Latin expressions, so you should replace &quot;e.g.&quot; with &quot;for example,&quot;.

This applies both here and in the other occurrence of this same note in the change.
|Add documentation for the Method enumeration here:

/*!
    \enum QWebEngineHTTPRequest::Method
    \brief This enum type describes the method used to send the HTTP request:
        
    \value Get The GET method.
    \value Post The POST method.
*/
|i.e. &gt; that is
|1) Add a comma after &quot;URL&quot;

2) Remove the second &quot;same&quot;
|QDoc cannot find this documentation, unless you specify the function signature here, as follows:

\fn void QWebEngineHTTPRequest::setMethod(const Method &amp;method)
|\a postData &gt; \a rawPostData
|Add documentation for this function or mark it internal to suppress a QDoc warning.
|Please check this documentation. The function does not have \a url or \a customHeader arguments, so you should remove the \a commands. The same applies to \a postData. Also, the documentation for \a request is missing.
|Update this documentation to describe the changed function. The previous arguments seem to be gone and the \a request argument is not documented.

|Ah, nevermind. Misread your comment :).
|Add a period to the &quot;qmldir&quot; string: \c .qmldir
|Then &quot;a qmldir&quot; should be &quot;a \c qmldir directory&quot; or &quot;files in a \c qmldir directory&quot;
|I'll remove these sentences, because they would not add any info to the docs of the function that is reimplemented here.
|Done
|As the bar set is different from the other sets, I'll change &quot;pie series&quot; to &quot;pie slice&quot;.

|I still think that &quot;getting something for a distribution&quot; indicates that you plan to distribute a package yourself, but you could also read it so that you are getting someting to add to your installed distribution. Using the word &quot;get&quot; here is part of the problem, I think.
|Add a comma before &quot;because&quot;
|1) Qt writing guidelines: add a comma before &quot;which&quot;, which means that the sentence is non-destrictive.

2) There is something wrong with this sentence. You could rewrite as follows:

&quot;Therefore, you get linking errors if you try to link libraries compiled with one GCC version to code compiled with another.&quot;

|&quot;Emulator graphics performance and quality (GL-streaming) were improved&quot;
|&quot;Virtual keyboard was improved&quot;

Maybe state how it was improved.
|&quot;\B2Q source code was made available…&quot;
|&quot;…were added&quot;
|&quot;\B2Q stack was extended with \l {Qt Quick Enterprise Controls}&quot;

or

&quot;{Qt Quick Enterprise Controls} were added to the \B2Q stack&quot;
|Here I would also place more emphasis on what was improved by placing it first.
|GDB
|What is &quot;qtlaunch&quot;? Is this the official way to write it?
|This is written &quot;Dora&quot; elsewhere, or do you want to emphasize the branch name?
|The heading is &quot;Bug fixes&quot; but the list contains bugs. Should these be in past tense, as the bugs have been fixed? Or you could describe the fix instead of the bug: &quot;Mesa headers were added for the eAndroid emulator&quot;. Or change the heading to &quot;Fixed Bugs&quot;, like for the issues. I would still use past tense.
|Is &quot;appcontroller&quot; the official way to write the name of the tool?
|&quot;emulator-eAndroid&quot; or &quot;eAndroid emulator&quot;?
|Fix capitalization (should be &quot;Embedded&quot;, if you use book style caps here)
|This entry is not consistent with the others, but as it is probably something that exists on the wiki page, you probably should not change it here.
|These could also have: &quot;Emulator:&quot; in the beginning. Or, as they are all emulator issues, you could change the title to &quot;Emulator Changes&quot;
|I assume the support was added, but there is nothing here that makes it clear (could also be modified or removed)
|Done. I changed this everywhere and I think it works pretty well, as the later occurrences of XXX are not explained in text and &lt;device_name&gt; is more descriptive.
|Didn't realize that these were two different things. I changed this back and will add the name of the build step to remove in Qt Creator to make it clearer.
|It is called &quot;the power button&quot; in the &quot;Preparing Nexus 7&quot; topic, so I changed it here for consistency.
|Done
|Done. I didn't change this, as you added this in the master branch, but there will probably be a merge conflict anyway, so I can add it here, too.
|&quot;But changes is not affects&quot; &gt; &quot;The change does not affect&quot;
|What is &quot;globbing&quot;?
|Use book title style capitalization for button labels: &quot;Run CMake Later&quot;

The UI text capitalization guidelines are here:

http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-ui-text.html#ui-text-capitalization
|&quot;Run CMake Now&quot;
|Qr Creator 3.4 is in string freeze, but as commercial features are not localized, you could probably change it, but I'm not sure the new name is better. &quot;Pending&quot; usually does not come with a time estimate.This field name is also displayed in the image in this topic.
|Please do not use the Doxygen format (with the asterisks).  Instead, indent lines with four spaces.
|\since and \inmodule commands are missing
|I think QDoc expects C++ class names to start with &quot;Q&quot;.
|Use the \c command to format EvaluatorInfo, unless you plan to document it and want QDoc to create an automatic link to it.
|\c AssignmentInfo ?
|\c ForeachInfo ?
|poitner &gt; pointer
|initiating &gt; initializing ?
|&quot;an opaque&quot;
|&quot;the ID&quot;
|Yes, I think QDoc also requires that class is used, for docs to be generated.
|You can remove the link from here, if you are adding it above.
|To answer your question, I think moving this topic to a file of its own would work. You would also need to add the title to the TOC in qtcreator.qdoc. If you move the topic, I'd also add a link to activating the plugin.
|In the manual, I try to use titles that tell readers what they can do, instead of referring to a technology. Have our readers found this title confusing?
|Yes, probably better without &quot;the project&quot;.
|One link to activating the plugin is enough.
|to build -&gt; building
|You can run &quot;make fixnavi&quot; or &quot;nmake fixnavi&quot; to automatically fix them. It uses the TOC to fix the links.

Basically, this topic should come after &quot;Clang Code Model&quot; and before &quot;Finding&quot;, so you need to change the \previouspage here and in &quot;Finding&quot;.
|You're missing the backslash: \l
|I'm still not happy with this change. Please think of a verb that describes what the reader is doing with the code model. If you cannot think of anything, we can add &quot;Using&quot;, but it is an empty verb which does really not add much information.
|You could mention this in the first \li element above: &quot;... select \b {Qt Quick 2.2} or \b \B2Q to create ...&quot;

|Patch Set 10: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The UI text looks fine.
|Patch Set 2:

The guideline for constructing window titles is to keep it consistent with the menu item or button name that opens the window: &quot;Use the menu item or button name as the dialog name. You can also combine the menu item or button name and the name of the object that is managed in the dialog. For example, the Add button in the Documentation options opens the Add Documentation dialog.&quot;

http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-ui-text.html

So, if this dialog opens from a &quot;Select Change&quot; or &quot;Select&quot; button, then this dialog title would follow the guidelines.
|Patch Set 2:

Then maybe &quot;Apply Actions on Commits&quot;, as that would describe what is happening in the dialog. We also seem to have a &quot;Select a Git Commit&quot; dialog with the same buttons:

http://qt-project.org/doc/qtcreator-3.0/creator-version-control.html


It seems like a bit misleading name (could also be  &quot;Apply Actions on Commits&quot;). How is that different from the dialog that you are adding the title for?
|Patch Set 2:

Sorry, it should be &quot;Apply Actions to Commits&quot;
|Patch Set 2:

If the string was lost in 3.0, I suppose we should treat it as a new string and add it in master.

Are all these now &quot;Manage…&quot;? I suppose that's fine, because then we do not need to worry about the &quot;Options/Preferences&quot; difference on the different platforms.

I tested this on a German Android device and it works well. Only the &quot;No Cities&quot; text does not seem to get localized. I don't think it's been marked translatable.

This topic should be structured so that the general information that applies to both online and offline installers is at the top. For example, the components that can be installed and the supported platforms. Maybe just a link to the supported platforms, though, as they are already listed in another topic. The online and offline sections should only contain information specific to that type of installer. Specifically, describe the benefits of both to help users decide which one they should choose.

Also, please check that you use terminology consistently. In many places topics that are not tutorials are listed as tutorials, which I find confusing.
|Patch Set 3:

This is what we had for the Qt 4 SDK:

You can download Qt 5 from xxx. The site provides download links for all supported development platforms. You can either choose to use the online installer or to directly download the installation package on a media for installation on a computer later.

We recommend that you use the online installer if you have reliable network access, because it provides you with automatic updates to installed content and easy access to all content that is added later. If you use the offline installer, you must check for updates yourself.

To get rid of the doc errors, maybe you have to document the functions and signals ;). 

Looks like they are partly inherited from other classes, though, and I'm not sure what QDoc expects you to do in that case:

Thank you for updating the docs! :)

There is one more typo to fix, and as David said, you still need to work on the images. Please check that you use the resolution mentioned in the writing guidelines (David's link) and resize the images to 75%. Also, you can crop the empty space from the bottom. The &quot;OK&quot;, &quot;Cancel&quot;, and &quot;Apply&quot; buttons don't need to be visible in the image.

No, it is fine to have some doc in the .cpp file and some in the .qdoc file (or all in the .qdoc file). Usually, it is good to keep the docs as close to the code as possible to make maintenance easier, though.

Are the spaces used for layout? Isn't that bad?
|Patch Set 1: (26 inline comments)

Some messages still contain single quotes. Mostly if the variable is not of the format &quot;%n&quot; or there is something between n and the end quote.

The following fixes could be made as a part of a follow-up commit:

- Where possible, move the variable to the end of the message and separate it from the rest of the message with a colon. This way, the quotes are not needed.
- Add full stops to the end of all messages. However, if the full stop might be misunderstood as being part of a variable value, you can either leave it out or place the variable value within quotes.
- Fix other punctuation issues. Mostly, commas should be colons or colons should be full stops.
- Fix typos.
- Use &quot;Error&quot; and &quot;Warning&quot; consistently. Now, they are sometimes written in all caps, sometimes with an initial capital. Sometimes a plugin name or some other identifier is included, sometimes not.

Tsk tsk, you're combining a linguistic &quot;fix&quot; with removing obsolete information here.

While &quot;linking against a library&quot; is fine, maybe the current text is a bit inconsistent (in the first occurrence, it  speaks about linking an application against libraries and in the second one linking libraries against an application), so I suppose it is fine to change it.

The text changes look good. Did you optimize the images? Please follow the guidelines here: http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-documentation.html

If the image quality suffers notably, though, don't optimize.
|Patch Set 3:

The menu text font size in qmlvideofx-camera-glow.png looks huge, compared with the other images.
|Patch Set 3:

The guideline is to use 1024x768 resolution and then scale the images to 75%. You'd need to check how well that works for your setup. Scaling would be a good idea if the image quality does not degrade too much.

Instead of &quot;Re-index&quot;, which I find a bit awkward, could we use just &quot;Index Documentation&quot; or maybe &quot;Generate Index&quot; or &quot;Regenerate Index&quot; if you like?

I stopped doing that, so that each UI control is now a \gui. It was more important for DITA support, though. I suppose you might be able to see the difference, but I don't think it is a big issue. I suppose I should switch to using \uicontrol when we drop Qt 4 build support for Qt Creator.

I still get the Qt 4 style when I build the docs from master. The doc config also looks old. The style on the website is correct, though: http://qt-project.org/doc/qtinstallerframework-1.5/index.html

I'll check if the doc config has been updated in the 1.5 branch.
|Uploaded patch set 2.
|Patch Set 2:

I edited the qdocconf files to fetch the templates from qt5/qtbase/doc/global (so you'll need to have it to build properly). Also, I deleted the Qt 4 templates and removed them from the doc.pri. As we only have one style both online and offline for Qt 5, I think we could get rid of the separate qdocconf files and just change the build commands. What do you think?
|Uploaded patch set 3.
|Patch Set 3: I would prefer this is not merged as is

I removed more files, and this still works, except that the version macro stopped working for some reason. We could also remove the &quot;make html_docs_online&quot; command, I think, because it now creates the same output as the &quot;make html_docs&quot; command.
|Uploaded patch set 4.
|Patch Set 4:

Could someone try building the docs and check that everything works with the changes? 

There should only be some warnings about deprecated QDoc commands (I already have an approved patch for that, which depends on this one) and some about missing docs, that should be added in other patches.

I'll change the copyrights for the existing files as a separate patch.

Is this what we would like to have in the docs? If you would only want to list IFW classes, we could list the files that contain them in the value of sourcedirs.

Currently, QDoc prints loads of errors and warnings that we might want to fix. Most of them are probably caused by missing documentation. You can get rid of those errors by using the \internal command for a class or function.

Also, some non-existent QDoc tags seem to be currently used. Supported QDoc commands are listed here: 

http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qdoc/27-qdoc-commands-alphabetical.html

You run make install_global_docs in qtbase. The instructions are here:

&quot;Custom&quot; would also work, but &quot;Predefined&quot; and &quot;Customized&quot; go together well, so this is also fine.

Eike, will master be synced with some Qt version, and which?
|Patch Set 1:

I think it is critical bug fixes only in those branches now, as we're really close to release. This is refactoring and can potentially break the Qt 5 docs, so I would not push it to Qt 5.3.

Sorry, but Tobias is right. You should use sentence-style capitalization for messages. The rules are a bit confusing, I know. You can find them here:

http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-ui-text.html

Basically, use book-style capitalization only for:

- Titles (window, dialog, group box, tab, list view columns, and so on)
- Functions (menu items, buttons)
- Selectable items (combobox items, listbox items, tree list items, and so on)

Changing the filename will break any links to this topic in the Qt docs that are not built using the Qt version that contains the changed file.

Did you follow the guidelines here when taking the screenshots: http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-documentation.html

Especially, did you resize them to 75%?
|Patch Set 1:

The guidelines are meant to make the images look similar in the docs, regardless of which OS and screen they are taken with. They were set Virva Auvinen and Thomas Strehl (a way back), and changing them again would just mean too much work.

The Options dialog, yes, but the Deployment page only shows a part of the options and not the &quot;Create Android Template Files&quot; button. Or are those displayed only after successful deployment of the app?

This is actually a good principle to follow. If one needs paragraph breaks, one should probably add columns, instead. Or turn the table into text, because one is probably trying to fit too much unrelated information into a table.

I built the Qt Creator docs with this style, and the following things are different from qt.io:

- Text area background color is grey
- The table background color is grey and there are no table borders
- The Contents box appear at the top of the page, instead of in the sidebar
- Section (1, 2, 3) titles are formatted as paragraph text
- Lists are not bulleted
- Nested lists are not nested
- code font is wrong

Harri, can you try changing the emulation layer in Options, as instructed in the new patch? That worked for me, when I got that message in the Design mode.

The color of the numbers used in the images has changed from blue to green (because the template color scheme changed), so I would have to take new images anyway, and I now have a Mac.

That is a checkbox label, so you should not use the colon after the text. The label should come after the check box. This is also wrong for the other checkbox in the UI file.
|Patch Set 3:

Yes, usually the check box should come first, followed by the label, without punctuation.
|Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

If we use it in other places, too, it's probably better to use it consistently in an original way.

I agree that it is much better if we can do things automatically. I don't know of any way of build Qt docs as part of our docs at method level. Basically, we could link to the Qt docs, but where there are differences, it is better that we do the parsing (determining which parts of the information apply and which don't) than making users guess.

I get the following error when running the installer on OS X 10.9.5: 

&quot;No marker found, stopped after 1.00 MiB.&quot; 

The installation continues after clicking OK in the message box and the maintenance tool is created in the installation directory. The maintenance tool can be run, but the repository seems to be missing, because I get the error:

&quot;At least one valid and enabled repository required for this action to succeed.&quot;

Removing the installer does not work, either: &quot;Info.plist: Permission denied&quot;

QDoc supports automatic linking to Qt module docs, now, so you can get rid of the URL for some of the links. Also, one topic has been released in the meantime, so you no longer need to link to the snapshot.

We could add a qtwayland-index.qdoc file that would contain the front page for the module docs. It could contain a short description of the module and the &quot;Getting Started&quot; section that describes include statements for the module.

I like &quot;CPU Profiler&quot; or &quot;Sampling Profiler&quot;, because they are short, and therefore it is easier to use them in the UI and text. I suppose we could also call it &quot;Perf Profiler&quot;, like we do for &quot;Valgring Function Profiler&quot; or &quot;Clang Static Analyzer&quot;.

Please check whether you introduced QDoc errors and fix them.
|Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

You'll need to take a closer look at the Qt Designer docs and related examples to see that you don't break anything.

For example, I think you'd need to modify the 3rd text paragraph here, before the first snippet:

http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-5.5/qtdesigner-customwidgetplugin-example.html

Also, if this is a new module, it would need to appear somewhere in the list of Qt modules here:

http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-5.5/qtmodules.html

Also, you're introducing the following QDoc warnings:

QtDesigner: WARNING: .../qt5/qttools/src/designer/src/lib/uilib/abstractformbuilder.h includes uilib_global.h when it should include QtDesigner/uilib_global.h
QtDesigner: WARNING: .../qt5/qttools/src/designer/src/lib/uilib/formbuilder.h includes uilib_global.h when it should include QtDesigner/uilib_global.h
QtDesigner: WARNING: .../qt5/qttools/src/designer/src/lib/uilib/formbuilder.h includes abstractformbuilder.h when it should include QtDesigner/abstractformbuilder.h

The docs for these classes are still generated under Qt Designer C++ Classes. Should they now be listed under the new module? Here is a checklist for adding docs for a new module:

http://wiki.qt.io/Checklist-for-Adding-Documentation-for-a-New-Module
|Patch Set 1:

If the text no longer makes sense after you change the implementation, it is &quot;doc breakage&quot; even if the docs could still be built and would *look correct*. Leaving it to a follow-up change is dangerous, because what if nobody ever makes the follow-up change?
|Patch Set 1: -Code-Review

Hmm, as Ossi is moving the files, maybe it is actually better to make the doc changes in a separate patch, so that they will be easier to follow.
|Patch Set 1:

Everything seems to still get built. Usually, you would put the qdoc files in a doc folder, though. That would then also contain a qddocconf file for the module, but according to Topi we don't need one here.

The link to the Qt Designer module is now broken from the All Qt Modules page (here, it still works: http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-5.5/qtmodules.html), but I don't know whether your changes are to blame.

I missed a typo and punctuation issue during the first round, but this already looks really good. Some of the tree diagrams do look too large, though, compared with the others.

For lists with short list items, I don't usually add empty lines between the list items, though. I do it more for readability when the list items contain a lot of (too much ?) text.

I thought it's too late, and the changes are not critical. 

Ossi, can you redirect this to 5.5.0?
|Patch Set 1:

It is very well written, with no grammar issues, so the changes can also go to 5.5. Jani?

Thanks for testing! I'll add a section about running the application in the next patch. There is already a screenshot at the top of the topic. The menu actions should work after you add the code. The Edit menu actions are disabled when there is nothing to cut, copy, or paste.

Also, in the current docs, &quot;Qt Quick Project&quot; is a top level term that means &quot;Qt Quick Application and Qt Quick UI&quot;, so this change will make the docs illogical.
|Patch Set 2:

Actually, maybe it will work, as the docs talk about &quot;Qt Quick UI Projects&quot;: http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/quick-projects.html
|Patch Set 2:

But &quot;Projects &gt; Project&quot; will look weird. And there are the following similar entries at the same level: &quot;Other Project&quot;, &quot;Non-Qt Project&quot;, and &quot;Import Project&quot;. The last is already a bit strange.

I think you'd need to write the whole tooltip in HTML if you want to use tags in it. For example, in \src\plugins\debugger\debuggersourcepathmappingwidget.cpp:

    setTitle(tr(&quot;Source Paths Mapping&quot;));
    setToolTip(tr(&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head/&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mappings of source file folders to &quot;
                  &quot;be used in the debugger can be entered here.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;
                  &quot;&lt;p&gt;This is useful when using a copy of the source tree &quot;
                  &quot;at a location different from the one &quot;
                  &quot;at which the modules where built, for example, while &quot;
                  &quot;doing remote debugging.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;
                  &quot;&lt;p&gt;If source is specified as a regular expression by starting it with an &quot;
                  &quot;open parenthesis, Qt Creator matches the paths in the ELF with the &quot;
                  &quot;regular expression to automatically determine the source path.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;
                  &quot;&lt;p&gt;Example: &lt;b&gt;(/home/.*/Project)/KnownSubDir -&gt; D:\\Project&lt;/b&gt; will &quot;
                  &quot;substitute ELF built by any user to your local project directory.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;
                  &quot;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;));

Yes, we only have it in one place in the qmake Manual, now. However, this is about linking to the list here: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtmodules.html

Readers would then have to click the module name to see the QT variable value for that module.

Place the images in doc/images and add the \ingroup command and \brief command to make the example appear in the table that lists widget examples with a description. Also, replace the deprecated \gui macro with the \uicontrol command. Fix paths to snippets (QDoc starts looking in &quot;examples&quot;). See my inline comments for details.

Ooops, didn't know that Nico had added it. It is not listed here, though: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/examples-widgets.html

Therefore, mMy comments would apply to that change, too. Is the correct process to revoke this change and just fix the problems in 5.5 or in 5.6 after Nico's change is merged?

We seem to use &quot;Remove&quot; and &quot;Delete&quot; interchangeably in Qt Creator, with a slight preference to &quot;Remove&quot;. Do these terms have special meanings in UML? If not, please use longer action names that make the difference clear.

We refer to &quot;release&quot; and &quot;debug&quot; builds all over Qt Creator and the docs, not to mention the qmake Manual and probably the Qt Reference docs, too. So moving away from that terminology would be quite a big effort.

Can you check that I got these right? The rules are:

- Use book style capitalization for titles and for options in combo boxes
- Use sentence style capitalization for labels


For the rules, see: http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-ui-text.html

Also, we have a small tool you can use to check how you need to capitalize a phrase when using book style caps.

Is it marked \internal in qtbase? You could replace \brief with \internal to hide the docs from QDoc in most cases. We have an option in the .qdocconf file to also build internal docs, but then they don't need to be perfect, IMHO.

You need to rebase and pull the latest changes to get the src/webengine/doc/src/external-resources.qdoc file that was added in https://codereview.qt-project.org/127139

Looks good and can be built correctly. Two general comments, though:

1) Usually, module names are written with a space in the documentation. According to the guidelines, the module name should be 'Qt SCXML':

https://wiki.qt.io/Spelling_Module_Names_in_Qt_Documentation

2) The general descriptions in this topic, including this new text, should be moved to an 'Overview' topic.

Please also change the label and fix the paths to the console in the documentation if you moved the console away from Output panes. This might actually require bigger changes, though. Currently, at least these topics will need changes:

- http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-debugging-qml.html - This section is in the correct place, but you'll need to change the label and check the paths.

- http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-quick-tour.html#qml-js-console - If Debugger Console is no longer an Output pane, this section can be deleted, but some of the information can be moved to the previous section.

- http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-qml-debugging-example.html - Change the label and check the paths.

Don't worry about the screen shots, I'll probably redo all of them for 3.7.

If the new design is implemented for 3.7, I'll need to take all screenshots again, so I'm kind of keeping things on hold until a decision about that has been made. But I'll update the screenshot at some point before the release in any case :).

I suppose it is your call whether to document Qt Creator code, because there is no hard requirement to do so. We sometimes get requests for Qt Creator code documentation, so I think it would be a good idea to add docs for new code. However, if docs are added, they should follow the doc guidelines.

I get this when trying to build the docs, but it is probably because of the typo in &quot;include&quot; on line 1 in the .qtdocconf:

Expected '=' or '+=' after key
|Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

Builds correctly, now. Also here, the index page would become more concise if you added a separate examples page.
|Patch Set 1:

Builds without problems.

For consistency with current doc style, the C++ Classes and QML Types should be listed in separate topics. But that can be done in a follow-up patch.
|Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

Builds fine and looks consistent with the current style, with one exception: you should create an examples page where the examples are listed.

QtWebEngineCore::initialize() docs would seem a natural place for documenting this, but they don't seem to currently exist. Should that method be documented?

If this problem is is OS X specific, it could be documented in Qt WebEngine Platform Notes: http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-5.6/qtwebengine-platform-notes.html

I can add that, too. Michal asked me to mention the initialize() command in the overview, so that would be a natural place. I'll do it in a separate patch.
|Patch Set 1:

Yes, you should create &quot;doc&quot; folders with &quot;images&quot; and &quot;src&quot; subfolders for each example. The &quot;src&quot; folder should then contain the .qdoc file that contains documentation for the example. You can copy can.qdoc and modify it as appropriate.

Would be a good idea to also move the can.qdoc file to examples\serialbus\can\doc\src, so that all the example .qdoc files would be in the same folder.

I think you can overwrite the bot for good reasons. Sometimes, images just are bigger than 50 KiB, even after compression. But here, I suppose you could still make the image smaller.

Would it be possible to divide the configure lines to up to 80-character chunks? That would work better with the CSS.

qt.index is a file that is generated automatically when the docs are built from a qt repository clone. Unless these links are actually used in the Qt Creator Manual, it would be better to stick with the official version. Unless, of course, you actually built the docs in the 4.8 branch and these changes have been made there.

|Patch Set 5:

I don't think that adding the term &quot;Context Specific&quot; helps much here. Maybe you could specify the context here. These are &quot;Debugger Views&quot;, right?
|Patch Set 5:

You can either have a submenu for the context-sensitive views (could be called &quot;Views&quot;), and then list all the views, with the ones not available in a given context disabled. Or you could just display the views available in a given context (and use the name for that context) and hide the rest. I don't know what the current thinking is for what is easiest for users.
|Patch Set 5:

I browsed some of the research on this issue, and it seems that while back in 1989 users were still in favour of static menus, they had come to accept and expect dynamic menus by 2004.

As we are in screen freeze for 2.7, our release manager, Eike Ziller, needs to accept all exceptions. I added him as a reviewer.

|Patch Set 1: (7 inline comments)

This is very well written, and I could find only one grammatical error. However, the style is somewhat wordier than the general Qt Creator Manual style, so I added some style considerations. Please read the writing instructions at  http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-documentation.html. Also, we need to decide together, where this should go in the Manual.
|Patch Set 1: (1 inline comment)

This looks very good now, thanks :). To be consistent, this topic should actually be placed within Mehdi's &quot;Connecting BlackBerry 10 Devices&quot; topic. That could be done by physically moving the text or by changing this into an qdocinc file (with correct section levels) and using the \include command to include it to the other topic.
|Patch Set 3:

If you want this information included in the release candidate, you should move pretty fast. However, we can me doc changes also to the RC.
|Patch Set 3:

I missed that. Where the documentation should go depends on where the actual feature is. If this functionality has been pushed to 2.7 before the feature freeze, then the docs can go in, too (the freeze date for docs is right before the final package is built). But if this functionality is in master, then the docs should also go into master and there is no rush.
|Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Does not seem to break anything and fixes https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTCREATORBUG-8627.
|Patch Set 1:

Should have said attempts to fix.
|Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I can see three problems here when building with Qt 5: 

1) It breaks the \include command (has it been deprecated and replaced with \input?).
2) It places the title on the navigation bar, but no Home link or other previous links.
3) It adds an empty box (borderless) in the footer that causes the text to be aligned wrongly, much like the empty box at the top used to do.
|Patch Set 4:

The third problem actually seems to be there in Qt 5.0.1, already.
|Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

This introduces green icons for the 4.8 style, which looks weird. Second, I think at least one \include command (added by recent BlackBerry 10 patches) is not changed by this patch, which would mean that it breaks after you submit the patch.  Third, this will break generating the docs with released Qt 5.0.0 and Qt 5.0.1. Is that acceptable?
|Patch Set 2:

1) Yes, I think we had differently named icons for offline and online, before. Not sure how big a problem this is.

2) If 2.7 has been merged back to master after the patch was submitted, you should be able to see it if you rebase.

3) I cannot build with the released 5.0.1, so after this change the docs could only be built with 5.1 or self-built Qt with this patch. If Qt Creator 2.8 is released simultaneously with Qt 5.1, or later, that would not be a problem, I suppose.
|Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

This seems to work now, but I'm not sure what the point of all these changes is. For example, if the styles and images for Qt 5 come from qtbase/doc/global, why copy them to the qtcreator repository at all? Also, instead of using \input and a macro to replace it with \include, why does \include not work directly?
|Patch Set 1:

What are you trying to fix with this change? The current configuration with \include command and the current compat.qdocconf works fine when built both with Qt 4.8 and Qt 5. So, unless the \include command has been deprecated, I don't see a need for this change.
|Patch Set 1: Do not submit

This works when built with Qt 4.8, but not when built with the released Qt 5.0.1.

The language now looks good. Should the description of the .png file be modified to tell where it is used, instead of removing it, as it still seems to be available in code?
|Patch Set 10: (4 inline comments)

Reviewed the comments for grammar and style. If you want to make sure that you are following the Qt documentation conventions for API comments, though, you should add someone from the Oslo doc team as a reviewer.
|Patch Set 1: Do not submit

We're still hoping that most people will install Qt 5, so the kits will be configured automatically. As this is a one-time task that not all users will need to perform, it is kind of out of place in the Getting Started section. However, we do get a lot of questions about it, so I will write a new topic about &quot;Configuring Qt Creator&quot; that will provide pointers to double-checking kits, compilers, and Qt versions, as well as other things that we get a lot of questions about: keyboard shortcuts, color schemes, settings for the version control system, devices, and plugins.
|Patch Set 1:

To answer your question, QDoc and the HTML it produces are unfortunately quite limited and do not support anything fancy. It has been designer for documenting APIs, which task it does very well, but is somewhat lacking for tools documentation.

You should only need to add any extra documentation that you find necessary for the overloaded version. Maybe there is something wrong with the values of the \overload commands?

I don't see how changing existing (that is already translated) strings is particularly &quot;translator-friendly&quot;, but the language is fine.
|Patch Set 2:

AFAIK, &quot;a deployable Qt Quick application&quot; is one that Qt Creator knows how to deploy and run on a device.

The string looks fine.
|Patch Set 1:

I think it's only you ;). Attaching different meanings to a term when it is written as one word and two words is never going to work. If we want to make distinctions between terms that are usually used interchangeably (username, login name, logon name), we have to define them in the dictionary and then use them consistently. Most users will still not get our &quot;special meaning&quot; when encountering a familiar term.
|Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

You could have also replaced these in the docs.

Hmm, I think I found 14 or so occurrences when I searched, but thanks!
|Patch Set 2:

@hjk: I've worked with some systems that had &quot;usernames&quot; for that purpose and &quot;login names&quot; for the use of the authentication system. The problem is that everyone is free to coin their own therms according to their needs. 

Here is what I found in wikipedia: 

A user is a person who uses a computer or network service. A user often has a user account and is identified by a username (also user name). Other terms for username include login name, screen name (also screenname), nickname (also nick), or handle, which is derived from the identical Citizen's Band radio term.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Username
|Patch Set 2:

Are you thinking about the German grammar, there? In English, compound words can be built in different ways:

&quot;There are three forms of compound words:
the closed form, in which the words are melded together, such as firefly, secondhand, softball, childlike, crosstown, redhead, keyboard, makeup, notebook;
the hyphenated form, such as daughter-in-law, master-at-arms, over-the-counter, six-pack, six-year-old, mass-produced;
and the open form, such as post office, real estate, middle class, full moon, half sister, attorney general.&quot;

http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/compounds.htm

However, I have nothing agains us picking &quot;username&quot; instead of &quot;user name&quot;. We can also fix all &quot;file name&quot; occurrences to &quot;filename&quot; (as we have the same inconsistency in the use of that term).

And, it is useless to try to convince me that one of these is &quot;right&quot; and the other is &quot;wrong&quot;, even though judging by hjk's research, &quot;username&quot; might have become the prominent form.

|Patch Set 1:

It is fine to use paragraphs in tables. We separate content (.qdoc source files) from formatting (.css), so if there are formatting issues when using the .qdoc codes in supported ways, those should be dealt with in the style sheets. If you start modifying the source code to better fit the current formatting, you might get surprises when the style sheets are changed.

I added this info, because devs are being confused about which plugins need to be added. It might not be such a big problem anymore with automatic linking and dynamic linking being allowed on iOS.

As I stated before, this was originally written for OS X and I've been trying to make it more generic. Shall I continue with that or abandon the patch?

At the very least, I think we should add some of this information to the multimedia docs, with a link to the Wiki page that lists the supported backends.

To link to an external resource, you need to add an entry for the link target to qtbase/doc/global/externalsites/external-resources.qdoc and then use that target in this file. 

For example, add the following entry:

/*!
    \externalpage http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3263&amp;user=guest&amp;pass=guest
    \title OpenSSL Bug 3263
*/

Thanks for adding the docs! However, please move the whole topic to a new file. You could give it the file name &quot;installerfw-offline-updates.qdoc&quot;, for example. That way, you can also add your own copyright and contact information to the license header, because this is your text :).

When I was playing around with this, it was really easy to create a non-working theme, where some text elements were the same colour as their background, for example. So, for me, it would be important to group the UI elements, so that I could just select colours for a couple of settings and the UI would still be usable. Maybe we could ask Diana de Sousa, who is designing some additional themes for Qt Creator: http://blog.qt.io/blog/2015/02/09/qt-creator-flat-style-ui-design-new-light-theme/#comment-1194950

Also, the names of the settings should not come from code, but should be in natural language: &quot;Background color&quot;, &quot;Text color&quot;, and so on.

|Patch Set 2:

All additional text clutters the Welcome screen, so I'm wondering whether users have asked about the blocked video access or reported it as a bug. This restriction is probably universal and not related to Qt or Qt Creator as such, and so we might assume the users to know what's happening even without the note.

I have created a new structure for storing qdoc files, and therefore the qtcreator.qdoc file should be moved to doc\src\ and the creator-project-autotools.qdoc file to doc\src\projects.

The creator-project-overivew.qdoc file contains good information, but may be too technical for the Qt Creator Manual, which is about using Qt Creator. This information could go into the Extending Qt Creator Manual, which is written for Qt Creator developers. Please move the file to the doc/api folder.

I added some style comments to make the text read more like the rest of the manual. Also, you should add some qdoc tags, so that the text will be formatted correctly.

The change to the qdoc file looks fine. I could not find any occurrences where this would have been changed even though it should not have been changed (that is, in documentation, when talking about VCS in general, no about code).

Tried to make the wording more concistent within a project type. Because the project types are somewhat different from each other, it is difficult to describe them in the same way.
|Patch Set 2:

The new graphical guidelines for screenhots state that all images are resized to 75%. Also, images should be taken in the original size of the dialog, to make it easier to keep them all to the same size and dimensions (as far as possible). I could crop some whitespace from the bottom of images, but there is plenty of space downwards and the image sizes are already pretty small, thanks to optimization.

|Patch Set 1:

According to the new screenshot guidelines, all screenshots are taken with the resolution 1024x768 and resized to 75% to make them look similar regardless of the display and operating system on which they were taken. 

Please check the content of the screen shots.
|Patch Set 1:

Also, you can open a bug about the graphical guidelines if you feel legibility is more important than a concistent look and feel. There are other ways of doing this (such as allowing the .css to scale the images and allowing readers to click the images to view them in full size), but this is the way chosen, and I cannot suddenly redo all the 300+ screenshots again.

Generally, I think these read better than the old terms. I googled the terminology, and others seem to mix and match 'Watch windows' and 'watching expressions' and 'evaluating expressions' as well:

&quot;If you enter an expression that has a side effect into the Watch window, the side effect will occur every time the expression is evaluated by the Watch window.&quot; (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0taedcee.aspx)

So, let's just try to use the new term consistently.

This text is mostly grammatically correct, but please consider the following style issues that make it more direct and clear:

- Use active voice
- Use present tense
- Use 'such as' instead of 'like' 
- For selecting menu items or specifying options, start with what the user can do and then give the full path to the item or option: To do x, select y &gt; z &gt; w.

I added some style comments. There were no actual grammar errors, though. We need to add some documentation about selecting tool chains and Qt versions for targets.
|Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

As we assume users are doing their best, just telling them they did something wrong will not help them do it right. Therefore, can you help me create a table of the supported combinations of targets - Qt versions - tool chains. You already have this information in some format, as you are using it for the checks.

The problem is that the files are not named like that. To achieve any kind of consistency, one has to make quite a few changes. However, some of the language check and style changes could be put in another patch.

|Patch Set 1:

I agree on that we should deliver the instructions for building Qt from source with the source files. The file that is replaced here does seem to contain more or less the same information as the updated version, so it is good to use the same file in both places, if it is really needed in both places. The only thing that seems to be missing from the new version is the section about reporting bugs. Maybe we should add that to the new version.

Looks good, but you might have also changed the other subtitles, as they cause a similar problem. And it would be more consistent.

According to the heading capitalization style used in Qt docs, you should actually change the heading to &quot;STL-style Iterators&quot;. However, we don't seem to be currently very consistent with this, so it is better to follow the style of the other headings within the topic, or to change them all.

|Patch Set 1:

If it is a trademark, we should capitalize it exactly as it says in the trademark. If you mean product name, however, we should decide what the product name is and then capitalized consistently. As an abbreviation of Qt Build Suite, it should actually be QBS, but Andre did not like that when I first created the document.
|Patch Set 1:

Well, the last time we discussed this, we chose Qbs. I don't mind changing it, but it needs to change everywhere and be used consistently. Changing it every time the developers change won't work. Also, all lower case names present a problem in documentation in that they look wrong in titles and in the beginning of sentences. This results in all kinds of workarounds while writing. Also, other tools seem to have begun to use more standard capitalization. For example CMake, Git, and so on.
|Patch Set 1:

No, I mean in the beginning of times, when I set up the Qbs Manual, and hjk made me change all references to QBS to Qbs.
|Patch Set 1:

I would go with QBS for &quot;Qt Build Suite&quot; or Qbs, when it is not a part of a command that you need to type verbatim. Only in the latter case would I use qbs.
|Patch Set 1:

And I think I've seen it written as QBS somewhere, but I don't remember where.

The HTML is generated correctly, using the style sheet from Qt 5. The help file does not get generated, but I don't see anything here that would break it, so maybe it is not related to this change.

We are getting there, but you still need to fix some values of qdoc commands to fix some links. The values of the \nextpage and \previouspage must be filenames or titles of existing HTML pages. The \page command determines the filename of a page.

Also, fix the way some product names are written and please consider the style issues I point out in the inline comments.

You need to use the standard punctuation for the tooltips. 

As to whether your should observe the string freeze, the main argument for that (in my mind) is making it possible for the translators to do their task well. It is really frustrating to spend a lot of time and effort on something only to have someone else's actions make the end result less than perfect. And having any English-language strings in the UI is less than perfect.
|Patch Set 2:

@Robert: yes, engineers always want to improve everything until the last minute, and that is exactly why we have screen freezes and deadlines and master for polishing and fixing minor issues.

|Patch Set 1:

I would not do this, as &quot;qbs-&quot; is actually a pretty short prefix and there are some vague ideas about putting all the HTML files back to one doc directory to solve some issues with locating them and redirecting links.
|Patch Set 1:

What I meant by that is that it is possible that the folder structure will change again in the future, because the current structure causes problems when finding the latest documentation or redirecting to it. But nothing has been decided yet or is in definite plans.

The front page for each Qt 5 module is called &lt;qtmodule&gt;-index.html to avoid conflicts. The Qbs manual front page should actually be renamed qbs-index.html to be consistent with this naming style.

I like the current terms, because they are symmetrical. And the documentation states that a &quot;stub&quot; is added, which I take to mean adding the braces and removing the colon. If we use your suggestion, we also need to change the text a little bit, as just replacing the term won't work.

&quot;Here&quot; would also work, if it refers to the cursor position. However, &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot; also seemed to be pretty standard use, when Googling a little bit.

In that case, the Modules are in the wrong place, unless the idea is to put Modules first and then items. If yes, you could consider subtitles: &quot;Modules&quot; and &quot;Items&quot;. Also, &quot;Module cpp&quot; should come before &quot;Module qbs&quot; if you want to keep the order alphabetic.

Not using contractions in UI text is a rule in Qt Creator context, and it would be good to observe the same rules for all tools (and for Qt itself): http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-ui-text.html. I also  observe this rule in all the documentation I write and edit. I marked some other issues that could be fixed as part of this commit or a separate commit.

This breaks the doc generation for Qt Creator, where we need to switch to using the qt-module-defaults.qdocconf file and specify a value for the QT_VERSION environment variable.

Two more thumbbars to replace. Also, it turns out that for C++ classes you do not need a descriptive paragraph, as the brief is repeated in the Detailed Description section. Sorry about that. Also, I think we should pull the overview information to a separate Overview topic to get rid of repetition and to make the overview info more visible. But we can do that in a separate commit.

It would be a good idea to take new screenshots. I don't have Windows, so I cannot do it myself.

If this patch is more about adding the files than adding the actual content, then everything builds fine and all the links seem to work.
|Patch Set 1:

Looks like the links don't work, because the &quot;depends&quot; variable is missing from the qdocconf file. That should probably be fixed in the release branch. I'll submit a patch.
|Patch Set 1:

I think I'll need to wait until the change in the release branch is merged and merged back to dev before I can add winextras to the depends variable of the qmake qdocconf file. Or could that be a separate change?

As to the remaining errors:

qtwinextras/src/winextras/doc/src/qtwinextras-module-cpp.qdoc:35: warning: Unknown command '\qtvariable'

This qdoc command will be introduced in Qt 5.2 (dev), so it should not appear when you build the docs with a recent Qt from dev (maybe from the root level, that is, qt5 directory)

qtwinextras/src/winextras/doc/src/qtwinextras-examples.qdoc:28: warning: Can't link to 'Qt for Windows'

This link points to the qtdoc module, so the error should not appear after Qt Windows Extras becomes part of Qt 5.2 and you build the docs from the root level.

I meant here: http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qt5-dev/qtwinextras/qtwinextras-overview.html

But maybe it can stay in the class documentation, because it is not a Windows feature, after all.

Not sure you should be copying documentation, though. Usually it is better to link, so that we don't have to maintain the docs in two places.

The lists are generated when built with Qt 5.1, but they are not generated when built with Qt 4.8, so this effectively breaks doc generation with QDoc3 (Qt 4.x).  Also, any items not listed in the list on the index.html page will not be displayed in the Contents list in Qt Creator.

|Patch Set 3:

To me, there is no clear difference between &quot;hidden&quot; and &quot;non-visible&quot; in meaning, except that &quot;hidden&quot; might indicate intent. Here, I suppose the non-visible editors are hidden on purpose, so I don't see a problem there. However, &quot;non-visible&quot; is somewhat awkward as a term, because how do you capitalize it, for example, and that is why I prefer &quot;hidden&quot;.  

Both terms would work better with the term &quot;Editors&quot; added, but that would mean checking consistency with all the existing menu items (that is, would &quot;editors&quot; have to be added to them, too). Also, I don't think the difference between &quot;Close Others&quot; and &quot;Close Non-Visible&quot; (or should it be &quot;Close Non-visible&quot;) or &quot;Close Hidden&quot; will be clear. Maybe &quot;Close Others&quot; should now become &quot;Close All Except Current&quot;, which would then actually fit well with the original suggestion for the new item.

|Patch Set 4:

The translatable string seems to be gone from patch set 4. I agree with Eike on that we should try to preserve consistency, so &quot;Search in Containing Folder&quot; would be OK in that context.
|Patch Set 4:

I would prefer using &quot;Find in This Directory&quot; (or &quot;Find in This Folder&quot;) everywhere, for consistency. I think &quot;this&quot; is actually clearer than &quot;containing&quot;, as a file is always located in a folder. And we need to choose either &quot;folder&quot; or &quot;directory&quot; and use it everywhere in the UI and docs.
|Patch Set 5:

The ellipsis is used to indicate that further action is required by the user before the action is actually applied: &quot;Place three full stops (...) at the end of menu item names that open a dialog requiring user action.&quot;

You can find the guidelines for creating UI text here: http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-ui-text.html

Not everything is correct, yet, but I'm fixing things when I run into them.

Sorry, I was not being clear. There are two correct ways to do this:

2) If this is a label: &quot;Select Native SDK path:&quot;

The differences are in capitalization and in whether you should place a colon in the end.  Unfortunately, the current version would be wrong in both cases.

Maybe &quot;Running Applications&quot; should be called &quot;Deploying and Running Applications&quot; as &quot;deploying&quot; means &quot;packaging and copying of the necessary files to a location you want to run the executable at&quot; (at least in Qt Creator docs).

Please don't become discouraged, your English is not so bad ;). The comments are mostly about following the guidelines set for a common Qt writing style and about using QDoc commands correctly.

These are incomplete sentences with an ellipsis in the beginning. The form of the verb depends on the part of the sentence that has been omitted.

To test whether the verb could be in third person singular form, try adding &quot;This option&quot; to the beginning of the tooltip in your mind. If the tooltip is still grammatically correct, you can add the &quot;s&quot;.

However, if you would need to add &quot;Select this option to&quot;, for the resulting tooltip to be grammatically correct, the verb should be in first person singular form (without the &quot;s&quot;).
|Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

OK, you convinced me ;). Let's try to keep this consistent to make things easier for translators. I think there might still be some inconsistency in the existing tooltips, though.

Looks really good. 

My comments are all nitpicks on style, no actual grammar errors. 

Also, I'm wondering whether the Qt WebEngine module really is the only module with new classes in Qt 5.8. Raises the suspicion that the new classes have not been marked properly in the other modules. 

Also, the &quot;All Modules&quot; page should also be modified to move the previous tech preview modules to add-ons and to add the new tech preview modules.

This is a big patch set, so it is hard for me to tell which docs break where. Please run QDoc for each patch and fix the issues that cause the warnings to be printed. As a rule, document properties in the corresponding .cpp file and fix doc signatures in the \fn commands. Also fix parameter names that change. QDoc generates docs for getter and setter functions automatically.

Seems to work. However, will the docs always be built with the Qt that they are for? I've pulled 5.7, but am using qmake from 5.6.1 to build the docs, so the title now claims them to be Qt 5.6 docs.

In principle, we are of course free to  guidelines for taking Qt Creator screenshots to replace the current ones here: http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-documentation.html

But I really don't see how we could manage to agree on the new guidelines and take the new screenshots in time for the 4.0 release that is planned for May 3: http://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Creator_Releases

I created a task for updating the rules. You can vote for it and add your opinions and ideas there: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-16076

Taking 300+ screenshots is a lot of work and takes a lot of time. It would be great to have some kind of semi-automatic system for taking the screenshots by using Squish.

I created a task for that here: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-16077

Please continue the discussion about the guidelines and improving the work flow in those tasks.

I also like the new theme, but I think hjk's comment about naming the themes is valid. The names should be as descriptive as possible and easy to extend:

- Flat (is this dark or light, will matter when a second option comes along)
- FlatDark
- FlatLight
- FlatPinkUnicorns
- FlatDark2015

- The link to this page is currently broken, because the value of the \l command do not match.
- This topic should have a \title command with the page title, and all \section2 commands should be \section1
- If you can, use book style capitalization for the title. Not sure what your options are, because you are automatically generating the page
- QDoc reads the &quot;*/&quot; string as a command to end the topic, so you'll need to remove all but the last one, unless QDoc is fixed to ignore the string within the \code command
- Something else breaks the page generation in the &quot;libsecret&quot; section, but I cannot see what

I really like the table format!

The &quot;Project Homepage&quot; links are also useful, but I suppose these external links will not work in the qch file. To make them work, you would have to add them to qtwebengine\src\webengine\doc\src\external-resources.qdoc or generate a separate 3rdparty-links.qdoc (it can be called anything, I think) for them.

Some of the &quot;Project Homepage&quot; links are broken in different ways. Maybe you could add a disclaimer that they are derived from the files and we do not check them.
|Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

When you have the time, please think about ways to pull the Project Homepage links into qtwebengine\src\webengine\doc\src\external-resources.qdoc or generate a separate 3rdparty-links.qdoc (it can be called anything, I think) with \externalpage entries for each homepage. You'd need to use unique titles, though:

/*!
    \externalpage http://zlib.net/
    \title zlib Project Homepage
*/
|Patch Set 4:

Please read the User Interface Text Guidelines (http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-ui-text.html) and the instructions for writing documentation (http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtcreator-extending/qtcreator-documentation.html). The plugin will need to be documented, but that can be done as a separate patch.

These docs don't currently get listed on the C++ classes page, because the \inmodule command is missing. Also, found some typos and added some comments about correct QDoc command usage.

|Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

I found a typo. Also, docs are missing. QML properties are not usually documented as returning something, I think.

http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-dev/13-qdoc-commands-topics.html#qmlproperty-command

Please run &quot;make docs&quot; (or nmake docs on Windows) and check the warnings and HTML output when you add docs. QDoc will help you find a lot of errors. For more information, see:

https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_Documentation
|Patch Set 8:

Also, the docs for all the properties of this class are missing from the C++ class doc. You must document them in the .cpp file using the \property or \enum command, depending on their type:

http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-dev/13-qdoc-commands-topics.html#property-command

http://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-dev/13-qdoc-commands-topics.html#enum-command
|Patch Set 9: Code-Review+1

There seem to be some default docs generated for the constructor (or maybe they are somewhere else in the file), but I think that can be fixed in a later commit for 5.7. Also, the property docs can be added later for 5.7.

The _lgpl files are used for docs that were copied from Qt WebKit. New C++ docs should be placed in the respective .cpp file. These should go to qwebenginepage.cpp and qwebengineview.cpp.

QDoc can only find the documented functions if the signature is identical to the declaration, including const qualifiers. You can find out what QDoc is looking for by checking the doc build warnings or looking at the headings generated by QDoc in the HTML docs.

I don't have anything against replacing &quot;executing&quot; with &quot;running&quot;, but there seem to be a total of 253 translatable strings that contain &quot;execut&quot; and 193 instances of &quot;execut&quot; in the Manual, so they should then be replaced too. And some of them are not so straight-forward: &quot;Running executable&quot;, for example.
|Patch Set 2:

Actually, it would be only 161 translatable strings, including 106 instances of &quot;executable&quot;. Would you also like to have &quot;executable&quot; replaced and what would you prefer as an alternative?

I suppose it is better that this message might be in English than that it is localized, but incorrect. You need to fix the verb tense, though.
|Patch Set 1:

Can you write a complete sentence in good English that describes the method? You can put the method name there, too, if you like. However, the current text looks incorrect and it differs from the method name, so no connection is established.

@Christian: I don't see a problem with this, because the string will not be visible anywhere, and therefore it should not matter that there are translations for it. The problem with changing or adding strings after string freeze is that they will appear in English in the UI even if the rest of the UI is translated.

The language is fine, but I'm wondering about the parameter name and capitalization. There is already a CONFIG variable at the top level.

Looks good, but some grammar fixes are needed.
|Patch Set 6:

(37 comments)

Usually, when you start a sentence with a clause that starts with &quot;in&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, &quot;whenever&quot; or &quot;after&quot;, you will need to add a comma at the end of the clause.

In Qt docs, we use &quot;that&quot; without a comma for restrictive clauses and &quot;which&quot; with a comma for non-restrictive clauses.

I think we are about to enter string freeze (unless we already did).
|Patch Set 4:

I would really like us to stick to the string freeze, because it shows the translators that we respect their work. However, this is an experimental plugin, so it might not matter if the text is in English in some cases. If you want it in, it should go in ASAP, to minimize the negative effects.
|Patch Set 4:

Yes, by 'you' I actually meant you, Andre', and Alessandro, who have been active in pushing this into 4.2.
|Patch Set 4:

I think we could just merge it ASAP, because most translators probably have not started their work, yet.

How about:

- Add \brief commands for each \class. These could use a standard format: &quot;The xxx class is used by compiled state machines.&quot;

- Add a short description about what each class does, and then a standard text about how they are only used internally by the state machines and the note about BC.

- Add basic documentation for properties, functions, etc.

|Adding supported targets in front page.
|I haven't changed the preferredWidth, it should work too.
|In the doc: &quot;The default value is that there is no limit.&quot; :)
|Jan-Arve? How does it work internally when you start putting items in a GridLayout while there is no columns set? Is there a default value?
|Note: I will have to review that function when I make use of degrees F. For now we only have degrees C.
|use getTempFormat function to retrieve temperature with translated temperature unit
|This signal was added because you cannot add a property that is not notified (see the three sliderXXX properties above). Except if it is constant, but for whatever reason I did not use CONSTANT before.
|oups. ok :)
|Why is this change only for Spanish?

|I should check that actually and then in other tests.

|hm, after discussing with ossi, this above won't work. however from your change below you still need a initTestCase and cleanupTestCase to skip

if (l &amp;&amp; l-&gt;nativeWindowDeco())

    QVERIFY(!(dock.windowFlags() &amp; Qt::WindowCloseButtonHint));
|@Mark Brand: without feedback from Matt Newel, I think we can still safely add the check before calling holders[count] (with or without the autotest below). What do you think?
|@Matt Newel: Is this line above actually needed? Holders are not used for positional binding it seems.
|We are testing bool QSqlResult::savePrepare(const QString&amp; query) when hasFeature(QSqlDriver::NamedPlaceholders) return true.

http://pastebin.com/vM2ytf3t

So I think this is the correct name, no?

Or maybe would you prefer tst_QSqlResult::positionalToNamedBinding()? 

But since I am calling the function savePrepare in the test when NamedPlaceHolder is true I think the name using savePrepare_NamedPlaceHolder is fine. no?
|If you add the guards here, then the function does nothing and whoever calls: &quot;if (handleDirty) prepareBuffer();&quot;, it seems useless.

If this prepareBuffer() is not relevant when QT_NO_TEMPORARY_FILE is defined, there are probably other changes to add.

I am not even sure why we didn't have:
handleDirty = !dev-&gt;seek(size);
currently it does not check for error.

|after discussion: In qt48 ci, tests run on 10.6 and 10.7. Test is passing on 10.6 and not on 10.7. that's why there is this check for the mac version.

|good to know. maybe the qmldir_private file too then.

maybe the solution in https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,59789 is a bit better then, since we don't create a new plugin.cpp but instead we are reusing the ones in private and controls. Indeed if we can generate automatically the new resources and qmldir files, no new files would have to be maintained but the pro files, no? That's 4 files instead of 2 though.
|agree for 'deploy'.
the idea is the user can rebuild the sources after setting this flag, and then having the QQC built within a single module. i.e. qmake QT_CONFIG+=bundle_qml_modules

This is not ideal though, see comments in https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,59789.

Actually line 132 and 133 could be replaced by:

|Looking at iaccessible2.pri, I see line 45:

# Do not add dlldata.c when building accessibility into a static library, as the COM entry points
# defined there can cause duplicate symbol errors when linking into a binary that also defines
# such entry points, e.g. anything linked against QtAxServer.
!static: SOURCES += $${MIDL_GENERATED}/dlldata.c

so if this is needed for the test, it should still be in the qaccessibility.pro file I guess. My 2 cents.
|the lsb_release script returns those info. Debian for the id and the content of the file for the release output.

|same here.
|same as for controls. Don't deploy the qml files if qtquickcompiler is used?
|As Tim suggested, I think it is a good idea to have something less generic than just qrc. It could be used not only for static, so maybe something like &quot;qrc:/qrcImportPath&quot; could work.
|maybe you want to do the same for GPU_BLACKLIST within parseGpuBlacklist() ?

|you can add CONSTANT:

|the opacity was used to have an animation on it.
|Could maybe an attached property &quot;Dialog.defaultFocusedItem&quot; be added to Dialog? The user could set this to true in the specified the item they want to have focus when the dialog opens. Default would still give focus to contentItem. Just an idea, not really sure how do-able this is.
|Why do you choose to include them and then exclude them is the config  does not contain the right configuration? The following seems clearer to me:

SUBDIRS += \
    qrfcommserver \

contains(QT_CONFIG, bluetooth): SUBDIRS += \
    qbluetoothaddress \
    ....

contains(QT_CONFIG, nfc): SUBDIRS += \
    qndefmessage \

|But I cannot call QSqlResultPrivate::resetBindCount(). Can I?

|When using shadow build both the test plugin and its qmldir file need to be copied over to the QT_INSTALL_QML folder.

In my previous attempt, I was copying only the qmldir QT_INSTALL_QML and not the plugin itself. Thus it was not found by the test.

$(MAKE) install is not run for the test. Fot the test plugin the installation is now

I am not familiar with this but the syntax is consistent with Sergio's change.
|Patch Set 1: (3 inline comments)

So we did:

- lupdate weatherapp.pro

-it generates the _fr.ts file

-ts file to send to translator, need to remember validating the translation

-when tr ready and validated, run lrelease weatherapp.pro to generated the _fr.qm file

-for this app, qm file copied to localization folder and loaded from resources.

The qm files are in the top level build dir (OUT_PWD). And the ts files are generated in the source tree (PWD/translations). Isn't this consistent?

I don't really see a unique way of handling translations by looking at Qt Creator and qttranslations.

This solution works and the extra targets look consistent with what I found. What do you think?

@Venu: To test, you need to check out the patch so it also pull the changes it depends on. Then you can build Quick Forecast with Qt 5.2.1 or Qt 5.3.0 for Android (or other). You need to change the locale of your device (i.e. Hindi) or if not available, i.e.Bengali, you can in main.cpp force QTranslator to load QuickForecast_bn at startup(My nexus7 does not have Bengali either)
Let me know if you need other info. Thanks for testing!

@Liang: uiLanguages is probably more appropriate to use than system.name indeed. But the on Mac/iOS, the uiLanguage for Chinese Simplified and Traditional are sz-Hans and sz-Hant while the system name is sz_CN or for example sz_SG. On iOS the system name change while changing the region, on Mac, it changes with the language,Qlocale.system does not change with the region but only with the language. I don't see a consistent behaviour here. Well, for now I will keep using the system name and I will have to figure out later if I should change to uiLanguages and thus how to handle the language names syntax issues - vs _

I have tested on Windows and it fixes the problem.

Just one comment about the selected text. When the selection is made for a letter like 'p', there is no padding between the bottom of the letter and bottom the selected area on Windows (see https://bugreports.qt-project.org/secure/attachment/39862/combo1.png).

|Patch Set 18: I would prefer this is not merged as is

Here are some findings for now.

I have tried on Ubuntu and Android. I encounter some issues when the handles are very close to one another. It becomes difficult to know which handle will be grabbed and how the selection with then behaves.

On Android, the selction is not clear when the control lost active focus (switching from the TF to TA and vice versa). It should probably be cleared.

On Android, press and hold a work select it. When selected, it seems impossible to drag the right handle. When doing so the handle &quot;jumps&quot; to the left handle. Moving the left handle is fine.

Thanks for the feedback Andrew.

This is needed otherwise the glyph are not desplayed well on Android for example.

In the doc it states though: On HighDpi &quot;retina&quot; displays and mobile and embedded platforms, this property is ignored and QtRendering is always used.

Is this a bug in Qt maybe?

@Andrew: This is also a problem on Android for info.

|Patch Set 5:

With the current design, it does not look good on Windows phone.

Depending on some items geometries compared to the size available, the app decreases the size of items in the zoom page, or removes some items in the long term page.

For info, QTBUG-39154 in layout prevents currently to use an invisible layout to gets its implicit size so we can't use it.

I have tested this change and iOS/Android/Mac/Linux. On desktop the app can be resized manually and in some cases the design is adjusted after navigating back and forth to reload the page. Compared to what we currently have, I don't think that's a problem. What do you think?

@Andrew, how does it look like now on WinRT?

Android: Same remark as for TextField: the selection is not cleared when selectByMouse is set to false. On Desktop I guess it is fine when selectByKeyboard is true.
|Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

Ok for not clearing the selection when selectOnMouse changes then :)
|Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

When selectByMouse is set to false, the current selection is not cleared. This is the case with TextArea also.

Also with TextField, not setting the handles active property to area.selectByMouse causes the handles to stay visible when selectByMouse is set to false.

Thanks for the feedback. I have made some updates.

Also, we had the idea of deploying the .qml/.js files only in debug mode (https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/68375/) but this was not possible due to QTBUG-34342 / QTBUG-34343.

Also it is a good idea to go the other way and fetch the files when needed like &quot;make install&quot; as suggested.

Also while we still have limitations the files must be deployed. The process is not quite right still but at least some documentation could be useful.

On OS X, the selectionColor and selectedTextColor in the popup menu does not follow the colors set in the ComboBoxStyle (same for the font also btw). I haven't tested on other platforms this behavior though, but on Ubuntu the font in the menu and in the label was the same.
|Patch Set 2:

Similar to what you did with the font, should the colors be set in the __dropDownStyle as well? Though the MenuStyle does not support it now: it has internal __selectedBackgroundColor, __labelColor and __selectedLabelColor.

If we create a Break object with:

- day (day so it would be easier to filter the break with the current sructure)

We could do something like this. Draw the break &quot;on top&quot; of the rest.

Or we could add breaks event for each tracks, but that would create a lots of extra data. 

Maybe there are other ways, just thinking of those for now :)

When some fields in the database are empty, it leads to the role index being different between the two conferences. And it seems that once a role index has been set, the view does not forget about it. In some case it hits another existing role number and displays whatever it contains (or nothing if empty) or it leads to crashes when the role does not exist. I try resseting the model but with no success.

What do you think?

Adding the city in the menu is maybe a bit too much repetitive. Could the city be only shown in the &quot;home&quot; menu?

on small screen like samsung galaxy fame and on landscape orientation the menu is higher than the screen.

Currently the height is buttonHeight. We could add a menuItemHeight of 110 instead if that works for windows phone too.

You shouldn't need to touch the resource file. It should be automatic. Is your device with the german locale? You can manually change  qtTranslator.load(&quot;QuickForecast_&quot; + QLocale::system().name(), &quot;:/translations/&quot;); in main.cpp to load the german file otherwise.

There are too much data here. The make file contains useful commands. After running make ts-nb, run make commit-ts so it will strip out the non needed part.

Some problems:

- Got errors while running the flat style example, like &quot;file:///home/caroline/git/qtquickcontrols/examples/quick/extras/flat/qrc:/ExtrasImports/QtQuick/Controls/Styles/Flat/ScrollViewStyle.qml: File not found&quot;

- in the style documentation import line at the top of each style is &quot;broken&quot;. import empty

- the auto tests are failing, but it may be only on my machine where I sometimes have some hiccups. You may want to give it another go if you haven't done so already.
|Patch Set 21: Code-Review+1

I didn't have the latest change, the flat style works as expected now :) For the tests, as told, my machine is not always reliable, so as long as it works fine for you, I am good.

I still have the import error though. The QtQuick.Controls.Styles is not a new module, and without the change it works as expected. Not sure where the problem comes from.

Thanks for the tip Topi. You were right [QtQuickControlsStyles] had no effect, I removed it.

Also, we used a lot of references to {QtQuick.Controls.Styles::}, and while those are correct, they are not needed. I think we should keep references to other modules when it is absolutely needed to keep the doc lighter and make the needed cross module references more obvious. Hope you agree :)

@Sergio, is this what you had in mind?
|Patch Set 1:

For info, when a condition is not met, it gives the info:

Some of the required modules (contains(CONFIG, linux)) are not available.
Skipped.
|Patch Set 1:

It would skip more code, the load/qtCompileTest calls should not happen on Windows for example.

requires() is also the way to skip a project, and will print which condition is not met.

Also, it seems this not good practise to have for example https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/92042/3//ALL.
qt5 should not be smart I suppose.

Hi. I am just trying to revert to the old behaviour here.

Also regarding the exponential notation (and QTBUG-7521), I found out we can already do something like: http://cutebin.fi/pncsojjvn
It is a quick sample code but that may do what expected?
|Patch Set 7:

Hi. Glad it sounds good! But we won't even need a patch. In the code sample, I have just subclassed QDoubleSpinBox using the current API available. There are many different use cases, so I think that is easy enough to subclass QDoubleSpinBox to create the behavior wanted. Maybe an example would help though.
|Patch Set 7:

Hi Thorbjørn. Feel free to reuse the sample code in a patch, I wrote it so it's fine. So I will merge this patch to fix the regression and will let you try the another approach in 5.6. Ok? :)

@Andy, Giulio: After adding patch https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/108974/

I thought I surely broke the documentation build on linux:!android platforms.

However, it seems no doc is built at the moment, and I can find the QtWayland module in the list of modules either:
http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtmodules.html

Is there something I am missing?

@Topi: I am not sure why you want to remove those files. I can't find any other *.qdocconf file in the module.
|Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

Ok, thanks for the updates.
(And since there is no doc for qtwayland, I do not need to make an update after https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/108974/ then)

@Thiago. Hi, after discussion we will let the kernel type/version out for now. In our CI, we don't run QNX. And on other platforms like osx we could end up with darwin and osx blacklisted. But we can still add it later if we have a use case for it :)

Note: This change will require https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/108515/ for ubuntu-14.04 to be detected.

I am blacklisting the test for now because I don't know how to fix this error. Maybe there is an easy fix for it, if that's the case and you have the time to do it, I will cancel this patch.

The idea of blacklisting tests here is to make the platform significant again in CI.

Great! It fixes the problem for me too. and I don't see the second error either. (My qt build is not a shadow build though) Let's see if the error can be reproduced again.

Even with https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/106159/ the test is still failing. Keeping this change alive.

With the latest successful logs and some local testing, blacklist the tests that causes problems on this plaltform.

I seems to me that 10.10 is the platform to blacklist for most of the cases now. I can't be 100% sure I didn't forget to blacklist a flaky test on a given platform but I think this will bring value to the tests anyway.

By blacklisting those 9 tests, mostly on osx 10.10, and by removing the insignificant flag, we would then make 45 tests significant again and be able to catch eventual regressions.

What do you think?

From what I looked at. And also because it has made people add the flag for insignificant for win32.

The one that maybe a bit too much is the win64 blacklist because of:
http://testresults.qt.io/ci/QtDeclarative_dev_Integration/build_02508/win64-msvc2012_developer-build_qtnamespace_Windows_81

For shadow builds, the BLACKLIST file that is found in the pro file folder may not be found.

See for example http://testresults.qt.io/ci/QtBase_5.5_Integration/build_00785/linux-g++_shadow-build_Ubuntu_14.04_x64/log.txt.gz
FAIL!  : tst_QGraphicsProxyWidget::hoverEnterLeaveEvent(widget, no hover) is failing while hoverEnterLeaveEvent is blacklisted for 14.04. It is because the test tried to find the BLACKLIST file using QString filename = QTest::qFindTestData(QStringLiteral(&quot;BLACKLIST&quot;)); but in case of shadow build, it will never look into the source folder.

I though it could be a solution to copy the BLACKLIST file to the $$OUT_PWD folder- What do you think?

The __FILE__ path is indeed not always absolute, it can be relative (to the build output). I think that as long as QT_TESTCASE_BUILDDIR is defined, the return mainSourcePath returned should be correct. I didn't check for QT_TESTCASE_BUILDDIR at first and did not always get the correct path.
|Patch Set 13:

Ok, I tried using QDir::currentPath() instead of the build directory.

In the case of testlib selftest, when executing a subtest, the currentPath is &quot;/home/caroline/git/55/qtbase/tests/auto/testlib/shadow&quot;

So the blacklist file cannot be found. The default behaviour resolve the blacklist past using the working directory too, which means it looks into &quot;/home/caroline/git/55/qtbase/tests/auto/selftests/blacklisted&quot; instead of &quot;/home/caroline/git/55/qtbase/tests/auto/testlib/shadow/blacklisted&quot;

The test on Red Hat have been failing 57 times for the last 200 builds I have checked (those 200 builds may include aborted builds). So it is not all the time but quite often.

Regarding the blacklisting topic, I do agree that investigating and fixing the code/tests are best. And also while I update/create a bug report for each test I move to a blacklist file, tests can stay blacklisted forever if no one investigate the problems.

However as long as a test is marked as insignificant, real regressions can be introduced without being noticed (for example tst_QDBusMarshall::sendSignalErrors() failure observed during the merge: https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/109467/).

The QUdpSocket test is insignificant on all platforms at the moment. While I am not familiar with this code, by using blacklist instead of insignificant_tests for this test, it can help make lots of tests significant again (more than 70 for that test).

This is what I am focusing on at the moment, for this test and other tests/modules as well. Making sure that blacklisted are not forgotten is of course an important state. But if fixing a test is not straighforward, having an intermediate blacklisted state for the CI is not a problem and even help identifying which specific tests are failing.

Add missing comments:

&gt; ok. thanks for your comments.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not 100% it would break but better prevent than treat afterwards (French expression) :))
&gt; so better find a change with minimal effects indeed. Your solution seems a good approach.
&gt; 
&gt; A change even more minimal would be to revert the changes with $(CXX) and even put back the silent: condition line. Create resolve_compilers.prf as you suggested but that contains only something like:
&gt; testcocoon:load(testcocoon). And load this resolve_compilers in the pro/pri files where needed. So this change would only affects Qt built with testcocoon and we don't loose the [sse] thingy.
&gt; 
hmm, if you leave off silent.prf from resolve_compilers, then you don't
run into that double prefix problem, indeed (i entirely forgot about it;
my solution would need additional fixes).
in that case i think this change should be entirely abandoned. just add
the testcocoon:load(testcocoon) lines (with a comment &quot;adjust
QMAKE_CXX&quot;) to the three affected project files - not as clean, but i
don't think we have to be extra-thorough at this point.

Hi Rohan. I was considering excluding the printsupport tests entirely from building if contains(QT_DEFINES, QT_NO_PRINTER) is true in auto.pro (there are currently 2 tests in kernel).

Regarding your comment in change https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,34186
I am wondering if it is better to let it as it then (2 skips for inittestcase and cleanuptestcase when QT_NO_PRINTER is defined) It would be the same for the test tst_printerinfo (https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,34186)

I agree with Jing. It would nice to have the option to enable it instead of forcing it. i.e. qmake --add-major-version.

Also instead of hard-coding the tool name version, it may be more flexible to have moc$$QT_MAJOR_VERSION and something similar in the source code to append the version to each tool's name instead of hard-coding it. The relevant version could be only store in one file and this way it would make changes easier in future versions of qt (qt6!) with only a single file to update.

Also I think it would be nice to have qdoc5 for more consistency even if we now moved qdoc3 to qdoc. So we start qt 5 with a clean state.

Adding a test case in patch set 2.
|Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)

With the change cff4683a, prepared queries can now store a named paramater to be used more than once. When using ?, thus positional binding, there is no name parameter.

When prepare is called from a query with ?, it causes an error when the feature QSqlDriver::NamedPlaceholders is true. Because holders values are called while holders is actually empty.

QSqlDriver::NamedPlaceholders is true for QOCI plugin only but the problem is independant of the plugin used. The added test case is an attempt to make the test runnable without Oracle installed. The qsqlquery only runs tests for the found drivers. Also the problem lies in qsqlresult, that's why I created tst_qsqlresult.

After reflexion, I wonder if instead of having guards before calling holders[count], this should just be removed because it seems useless.

Adding Matt Newell who wrote the initial change cff4683a for comments on this.
|Patch Set 2:

Also the sha1 is cff46983a
|Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)


|Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)

I changed hasFeature(NamedPlaceholders) to return false instead of true in qsql_oci.cpp.

Then I tried:

    query.prepare(&quot;INSERT INTO MYTABLE (ID, NAME, BIRTH) VALUES(?, ?, ?)&quot;);
    query.addBindValue(1);
    query.addBindValue(&quot;foo1&quot;);
    query.addBindValue(QDate(2012, 11, 29));

    if (!query.exec()) {
        qDebug() &lt;&lt; &quot;insert with ? failed&quot; &lt;&lt; query.lastError().text();
        return 3;
    }

And I got the message error:

    Error: insert with ? failed &quot;ORA-009 Unable to execute statement

So I wouldn't change that value :)

Built on Windows 7 with mingw, and run sql tests successfully.
|Patch Set 1:

It is currently necessary to add QT+=sql-private in order to do for example:

#include &lt;QtCore&gt;
#include &lt;QtSql/QSqlDatabase&gt;
#include &lt;QtSql/QOCIDriver&gt;
#include &lt;QDebug&gt;

int main(int /*argc*/, char * /*argv[]*/) {

    qDebug() &lt;&lt; QSqlDatabase::drivers();
    return 0;
}

Because QOCIDriver (for example here) includes the private header. See bug report:
https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-28088

The problem is the signal activated() won't be emitted when there is an itemdelegate set (I missed that in Iff3e5c1c)

What about keeping mouse.accepted = false but calling root.activated in onPressed instead? Like:

if (listView.currentIndex !== -1)
   root.activated()


And adding the new test:


    function test_activatedWithDelegate() {

        var component = 
Qt.createComponent(&quot;tableview/table_delegate.qml&quot;)

        compare(component.status, Component.Ready)

        var table =  component.createObject(container);

        verify(table !== null, &quot;table created is null&quot;)

        table.forceActiveFocus();

        compare(table.test_activated, false)

        mouseDoubleClick(table, 15 , 55, Qt.LeftButton)

        compare(table.test_activated, true)

        table.destroy()
    }

|Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Kai, now that we have pro files for each example, I was thinking making this change.

After talking with Iikka I think this will not work though.

It seems that during the package creation &quot;make install&quot; is not called for the examples but instead the examples sources are copied directly in the package, what's called &quot;injection&quot;.

So it is not possible to move up the qt quick controls examples for the package sake, right?

We are too close to the release for this change now. I am concerned it could break the CI in some modules. That's is the point of that change and it is valid but we may not take the risk at this stage.

I think this gives minimal change to the files. People can still specify a path to another style using QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE

One thing is that now you need to import QtQuick.Controls.Styles to be able to import QtQuick.Controls.Styles.Private.

Alan, what do you think of registering the private plugin in QtQuickControlsPlugin::initializeEngine?
|Uploaded patch set 4.
|Patch Set 3: (1 inline comment)


|Patch Set 4:

&quot;Why do you not want a private plugin? That is the correct solution, and this solution does not make the private plugin APIs any more restricted.&quot;


Removing the private plugin simplifies the solution to embed the qml/js file in a resource file. See:
https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,61975

The plugin would then contain all the c++ api and it would be easier to embed all the qml/js files in it. Those files would be loaded if they are not found locally (actually if ApplicationWindow.qml is missing, the files are loaded from the qrc). From a deployment point of view, only 1 plugin and 1 qmldir would be needed.

If we have the private plugin, we may need to keep those 2 plugins or to duplicate the c++ api of the private plugin inside the non-private one and also have another qmldir. And if we keep the 2 plugins and want to embed the files in resource, I haven't found a nice solution to deal with the Base style; some files are used in the Private module, some in the Style module and some other are common and should be available for all files.
|Patch Set 4:

Anyone else with comments? Do you think like Alan that having 2 plugins with local import instead of module import may be a better solution than the one presented here?

There is maybe a better solution looking at: http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qdoc/13-qdoc-commands-topics.html#example

if we remove &quot;controls&quot; from the the example dir in the qdocconf file and use &quot;controls/examplename&quot; instead, a file called controls-examplename.html is generated. to investigate.
|Patch Set 1:

Jerome I have added https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,63056 if you want to have a look. 

Also even if text and touch are indeed very generic, they are under quick/controls and their title starts with &quot;Qt Quick Controls -&quot; It looks clear enough to me both in Qt Creator and in the folder structure. Is there something else you are worrying about?

|Patch Set 3:

Here is another version using 2 plugins (4 files). I am using the plugin.cpp of the controls and private modules. Also instead of registering the qml files in the plugin.cpp, I do it in the qmldir files so the changes to the cpp files are minimal.

The QtQuick.Controls.Styles module is available via the QtQuick.Controls plugin.

Private API are only available when importing QtQuick.Controls.Private (unlike https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,59065 - single plugin)
|Uploaded patch set 4.
|Patch Set 3: (3 inline comments)

This solution and the solution in https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,59344 require a cleaning of QtQuick.Controls ONLY and qmake QT_CONFIG+=deploy / make.
(Qt Quick Layout is a separate module.)

As Friedemann said &quot;Works in principle but...&quot;

Let me gather here concerns that remain:

- With those solutions the users need the sources.

- Then, having to remove the current installation is probably not a good solution. But then deploying to something like QtQuick/Controls/Deploy does not sound too good either.

- One way could be to make those available in a file to download somewhere. That's something else to take care of.

- The deployment qrc/qmldir files need to be maintained and prone to errors. and need to be tested too.

I can't see a solution that really convinces me at the moment. (for memo, gathering the currently installed files inside a single plugin does not work because the dll cannot be loaded when embedded in a resource file)

But now there are two questions: what can we offer to users in the short term (from 5.1.1) and what can we change in 5.2 in Qt Quick to solve this problem in a general way for Qt Quick Controls and other Qt Quick based projects.

|Patch Set 6: No score

No nice to maintain, but I can't think of another solution at the moment.

The idea is the user will run qmake QT_CONFIG+=deploy and only 2 files (1 dll and 1 qmldir file) will be deployed under QtQuick.Controls and could be used while deploying their app.
|Patch Set 6:

I should also add that with this solution, all c++ API is available when you include QtQuick.Controls to the project, i.e. the c++ private API are also register as part of QtQuick.Controls (instead of QtQuick.Controls.Private without the 'deploy' configure option.)

While the structure is slightly different from the original one, this allows the controls to be deployed as a single plugin. As long as it is only used for deployment I think this is fine but we can discuss it. A solution using 3 dll/qmldir is still possible.
|Patch Set 6:

I need to register the qml files because there is no qmldir file in the qrc file for the controls. And if I add one it does not work, because the module name has to be QtQuick.Controls which conflicts with the original one, i.e. the one in qtbase/qml/QtQuick/Controls loading the plugin.

For info, I have also tried something else as suggested by JP: embedding all the qml/js/and dlls files from qml/QtQuick/Controls inside a plugin (and respecting the tree structure) but it does not work. The dll cannot be opened when they are inside a qrc file.
|Patch Set 6: (2 inline comments)

the qml files need to be registered, via the qmlextensionplugin or via a qmldir. The qmldir conflict is when you have 2 qmldir files for the same module (one in the qml tree and one in the qrc file in this case)

But since then, I have actually found out that I could add in the &quot;not in qrc&quot; qmldir file, a path to the qml files inside the resources using the full path, i.e. 

Button 1.0 qrc:/Deploy/QtQuick/Controls/Button.qml

I think we should keep the back button even on Android. In the Play Store for example, there is a back button on the top left and at the time the back &quot;key&quot; can be used to navigate back.

I agree with the change but I am not so sure about the test/bug.
|Patch Set 1:

on Windows it is also default to a.m./p.m for me. But when opening the settings panel for the time, when using the NZ locale, AM/PM is also there. But only second in the combo box. On Mac and Linux it seems this cannot be changed, default is AM/PM. 

It looks ambiguous to me but I am not an expert. Thiago re-assigned the task to John Layt and maybe he will have The answer :)

This change generates automatically some c++ code for the call to qmlRegisterType on the qml files.

This is handy because you have less code to maintain but in the other hand it can make the code difficult to read since you don't know the content of the macro until the code is built.

The ios problem has been fixed so updating to initial change.

https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-34342
https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-34343

Otherwise it fails on Windows builds where the config release_and_debug is used but only release is built. On Windows empty Private and Style folders are created in the target directory when running qmake and the release plugin try to load qml files from there, thus it creates a failure.
|Patch Set 3:

Fawzi Mohamed		12:25 PM

I am thorn about this change. From one side yes the files are not needed in the application, but it makes toolability worse (no debugging, worse code model), and I wonder if release build == Not used for development. I guess worse tooling is expected in a release build, but I wonder if this is the right trade off
	
Shawn Rutledge		12:34 PM

Yes it's the right tradeoff, because it makes no sense to bundle QML files twice into every Android app when the user can't access them either way. And developers can use debug builds.

Fawzi Mohamed		12:40 PM

I fully agree that it makes no sense to ship them in the application, but I wonder if the &quot;don't ship&quot; should not be done in another place (in the deploy step of the application)
|Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Under discussion


The windows deployment tool does not deploy the .qml/.js file. That's a good approach too.

But it also means that each tool would need to know the modules that have files in both resources and the directory. Currently only Controls and Dialogs module have this structure (I think).

Tony do you know?

Putting -1 for now just to be sure everyone agree before it could go in :) I am not familiar with QtWayland but I think this can be cleaned up a bit.

For info in 5.4 and 5.4.1 integration, the only stage I find is:
&quot;linux-g++_developer-build_OpenSuSE_13.1_x64&quot;
|Patch Set 1:

Hmm, I am a bit confused. I would think that https://codereview.qt-project.org/92042  is correct. Because QtWayland is not a module used on all platforms.

I am not sure why non relevant platforms have been added in CI. We can let a module &quot;decide&quot; that it will be built or not on a platform, but in the case it does nothing, it &quot;wastes&quot; a checkout/configure... It does not feel optimal. But maybe I am wrong, I don't have much experience with the CI.

Are the platform builds added to stages automatically?
|Patch Set 1:

Ok, so it seems that it should be up to the module to decide, because for example when the whole Qt 5 is built, if QtWayland is not properly configured in its pro file to do nothing for such platforms, then it can break the whole build. Isn't Tony?

One thing though, is why they have force success set? Won't it hide problems?

Well I guess, I will abandon this change then. Or anyone with other comments?

With https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/110509/ and this change, we wanted to mimic the behavior of /usr/bin/lsb_release script by checking also /etc/redhat-release and /etc/debian_version.

By adding moving the piece of common code static QByteArray getEtcFileFirstLine(const char *fileName) into the other change, it appears, what's left for this change did not seem to justify a new patch set.

Also by squashing the patches, the commit message explains fully and in one place the expectations behind the change.

Hi Oleg. Thanks. I have submitted https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/101573/ for cleaning up the QString / QUrl inconsistency. It will certainly conflict with yours.

About forcing another style, is your main target to allow the end user to switch between different styles or is it to set a new style at startup, instead of using the current QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE env variable? We are currently discussing how we could achieve that, but we have not agree on a solution yet.

If this is about switching styles on the fly, could you do it in a separate patch. It is usually easier to review a patch that does only one thing (if possible to split the changes)

About fixing the situation where the non-existing absolute path given by the user doesn't exit, this could be done in a seperate patch as well. Though I am not 100% sure the plugin should take care of this.

Better with a test indeed. In 5.5, there is a test for blacklist available under tests/auto/testlib/selftests/blacklisted. Maybe you could add a test function in there after the merge is done instead of adding a new test?

I have set backSwipeEnabled to true on Android to see how it behaves. It works fine expect when an page is pushed from the menu, the mouse area in main does not receive the event and the &quot;swipe&quot; does not work. I can't test on Windows Phone so just a side note.

There are other controls that would need to have the selected colors updated when the window changes focus, like TextField, SpinBox, editable ComboBox... This is not a regression but it would be nice to update (in another patch maybe) so all the controls behaves the same.

|Patch Set 2: Code-Review-2

WIP: Looking at Qt::KeyboardModifiers QKeyEvent::modifiers() in /home/caroline/git/5.4/qtbase/src/gui/kernel/qevent.cpp, modifier are added when a &quot;key&quot; matching a modifier is added.

When checking the key events (for example using a QWindow or in a QML Item) when shift is released, the matching modifier is cleaned. Which is not the case currently using QTest::keyEvent. This seems to fix the problem. However I am not familiar with this code so wonder what you think about this change.

I should probably add an autotest (not sure where yet :))
|Patch Set 2:

Thanks Friedermann!

With the current implementation, QWindowSystemInterface::handleKeyEvent returns:
- on Press, key Shift and no modifier: modifier ShiftModifier
- on Release, key Shift and no modifier: modifier NoModifier

While on physical Shift press/release:
- on Press, key Shift: modifier ShiftModifier
- on Release, key Shift: modifier ShiftModifier

releasePressEvent is inconsistent between those calls.

Width the patch you suggested, the release event modifer would be 0 as you expect when Shift is physically released but the release event modifier generated would be ShiftModifier.

I wonder if when sending a Shift key, the Shift modifier should always be set maybe?

I have tested using:
http://cutebin.fi/p6dsher6l

I am not really sure what's the correct behaviour.

This works for me when building and installing the docs:

- make docs
- make install_docs (which copy the doc over to the compiler doc dir)

Antti, in the installed package the qch file for the VKB is under EnterpriseAddOns/QtVirtualKeyboard/1.0/Src/doc. But the doc is not under the gcc_64 (linux) folder.
How to you build the doc for the VKB?

Also when doing make install_docs, the doc doesn't need to be registered in Qt Creator, at startup it picks up the doc automatically it seems.

Also if the examples-manifest.xml is not in the QT_INSTALL_DOCS path, it cannot be seen by Qt Creator. So make install_docs seems to be needed for seeing the examples in Creator.

This is interesting...

Here is the ploblem I tried to solve here. In this case dummyplugin.h contains both functions declarations and functions definitions. So dummyplugin.h is subject to instrumentation.

When the dummyplugin project is built, both dummyplugin.cpp and dummyplugin.h are instrumented because dummyplugin.h is in the current directory. As said above, dummyplugin.h instrumentation is not empty because it contains functions definitions. 

If another project (e.g. dummyplugimemory) uses dummyplugin.h and dummyplugin.cpp, it will include the instrumentation for dummyplugin.cpp (ie source file) but will not instrument the code in dummyplugin.h (ie header file) because it is not in the same folder. The reason is to avoid instrumenting templates and inline functions of 3rd party library.

Thus the instrumentation of dummyplugin.cpp is not consistent between dummyplugin and dummypluginmemory project and their instrumentation databases are incompatible and cannot be merged.

BUT your point about e.g. qatomic_windows.h makes me realise that some headers files of the Qt modules are never instrumented because their are not part of a project folder. It is silent in this case because no file uses them for their own instrumentation since no one includes them for their instrumentation. But qatomic_windows should be instrumented as I see it has inline functions. I am not sure how to solve this at this point. Thus identifying all those headers per folder and include them in a nice way. The headers are copied to $$QT_MODULE_INCLUDE_BASE so we may include this folder but this may lead to some header files being instrumented twice if they are also instrumented as part as a project (like qdbusabstractadaptor.h). I need to check, I don't know a solution yet.

Thanks for raising this issue.

|Patch Set 1:

This will not decrease the coverage.

Coverage data is saved every time __coveragescanner_save() is called. In which execution report (csexe) depends on the last application/library who called _coveragescanner_install.

Each binary that is built with test cocoon will generate execution data for the code that has been executed by the application. In the case of application.exe, the data can be saved in application.csexe or plugin.csexe if the plugin was loaded by application.exe and if this application has called __coveragescanner_install before the plugin actually called it itself. In both case, the execution report is found in the application folder.

To get the coverage info for a test, all the csexe found in the test folder and subfolders need to be merged. This is what is currently done in post-treatment. And this is why for a QTest test TestA, you need to actually select the coverage reports from TestA and tc_TestA to get the actual coverage provided by a TestA. tc_TestA is the coverage info found under TestA folder but not directly associated with TestA in the csexe report. This level of details is not directly reported though in the final html report, it is available &quot;manually&quot; using coverage browser and loading the csmes database. 

But coverage info can be merged to a test only if they are not already associated with another test (like a QTest subtest). &quot;Associated with a test&quot; means that __coveragescanner_testname has been called with a non empty test name and the coverage info is saved under this test name in the csexe report. Also this is only the case for QTest and QtQuickTest based tests with the current implementation.

Subtests of QProcess, QApplication and QClipboard for example are Qt applications but not QTest based tests and that's why their subtests status don't appear in the final report. However, in post-treatment, their coverage info is merged and used.

Selftests subtests are QTest based subtests, and until now a status was reported for them but this was incorrect and this is where this change is useful. 

Does it clarify the point?
|Uploaded patch set 2.
|Patch Set 2:

Yes, this will indeed increase the coverage reported for tst_selftests (The final/global coverage will stay unchanged though). The subprocesses coverage data will be merged with the main test during the post processing steps (qtqa scripts).

And the purpose of this change is also to avoid the QTest subtests to show up in the report. -skipcoverage can be considered as an implementation detail since it is used for one test only for now. It is more accurate though. Using -subtest was a more generic name and could eventually be reused for other purpose if needed at some point, they are subtests after all. If the option must refer to coverage, I would actually rename it something like -subtestForCoverage, what do you think?

Only the *.c and *.cpp are shown in the html report. The choice made to not include the header files is arbitrary. While some headers contain inline and/or functions definitions, it is not possible to show only those in this report. While having headers is relevant (and there is a know issue QTQAINFRA-345) I think that having all the headers decreases visibility since most of them don't have code to test for code coverage. This can easily be changed though. What do you think?

|Patch Set 1:

Attempt to solve task QTQAINFRA-345 with including all the HEADERS (not from 3rdparty folder though) in the instrumentation, shows build time and database size issues.

Testcocoon needs to create instrumentation for each header file that contains inline functions and function definitions. This is very slow (build not finished after 1 hour) and the database sizes increase (qtbase size is 90GB after 1 hour).

Removing all the headers from the instrumentation makes the current solution less confusing.
|Patch Set 1:

There are the options --cs-include-path/--cs-exclude path. But the problem was to find for each module the module/src folder.

QTBUG-22238 states the tests are not failing anymore. If that's right, the QSKIP should be removed and not replaced by QEXPECT_FAIL.

If the tests are still failing QEXPECT_FAIL implementation is fine but it needs a new bug report.

I didn't get the reboot but a failure on 10.6. (I asked someone to tried on 10.7)

However with the risk of reboot EXPECT_FAIL should not be used.

I would rather keep the QSKIP though. If we &quot;ifdef the whole functions out&quot; I think the problem will never be looked at.
|Patch Set 1:

Thanks J-P! I will add the QSKIP back. If we comment the functions they may just be ignored. I will add the ref to the bug report.

Maybe do you have a qt4 in your path?

&quot;error: macro &quot;QSKIP&quot; requires 2 arguments, but only 1 given&quot;

QSKIP used to have 2 arguments:
http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/4.8/qtest.html#QSKIP

Now it has only one:
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtest.html#QSKIP

Also I will investigate if contains(DEFINES, QT_NO_PRINTER) works and then I could indeed just exclude the test!

Is this needed here? It contains only preprocessor directives.

Is it needed in src/multimedia/qmedianumdebug.h though as it contains inline code without QT_BEGIN/END_NAMESPACE?

&quot;2 - All code that is not a preprocessor directive or a comment must be wrapped in QT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE and QT_END_NAMESPACE. As a rule of thumb this applies do all definitions and declarations concerning types, objects etc with identifiers starting with ‘q’ or ‘Q’.&quot;

|Patch Set 3:

The test is failing on my Mac 10.6 because the folders test and test2 don't appear first in the list. On Mac files order depends on the locale. By renaming the folders ATest and ATest2, the test then passed for me. But we cannot assume this will always work.

Also the non native dialog is tested on other platforms and it is not widely used on Mac.

Thus it is probably better to disable the test on Mac.

The test passed on Ubuntu 11.10.

If we put it within QtDesktop we will have to modify the QtDesktop qmldir. I would rather have a separate folder that we can fill with the testing data we need without interfering with the components.

Also why only for the developer build? We need to be able to test the non developer builds too, no?

Jens, any comments?
|Patch Set 6: Looks good to me, approved

Thanks for your feedback Liang. We agreed the structure should be fine. And the API used here being public, we don't need to have those tests enabled only for developer builds.

WIP: This will not work for shadow build.

Memo:

qtdesktop.pro

TEMPLATE = app
TARGET = tst_qtdesktop

testplugin_path = $$PWD/../testplugin
win*: testplugin_path=$$replace(testplugin_path, /, \\)
message($$testplugin_path)
check.commands += (set QML2_IMPORT_PATH=$$testplugin_path) &amp;
...
|Uploaded patch set 2.
|Patch Set 2:

Attempt to use macro IMPORTPATH

This macro will append the path to the plugin to testrunner.
So when running ${MAKE} check, qmlscene will look in the
specified path too to find plugins. This avoid/replace the need of setting QML2_IMPORT_PATH at run time.

The difficulty is that we need to know the path of the plugin. And here in the plugin I set DESTDIR. This forces in-source build for shadow builds and this is not a long term solution.

It seems the problem is &quot;QPluginLoader checks that a plugin is linked against the same version of Qt as the application.&quot;

In my case, when I run the test a second time, the test is then passing.

This issue is not related to this change. Maybe the plugins need to be build along the test?

In qt48, maybe the string should be updated then? It could look for &quot;not a valid Qt plugin&quot; or &quot;Plugin verification data mismatch&quot;?

Ok I guess you didn't want t to add QSKIP for loadCorruptElf() because it uses data (it worked when i tried it)
But anyway the patch is good and this should not stop it. Good to go for me.
|Patch Set 9: No score

I don't have a Mac to test it but looking at qtLibraryTarget in qt48/mkspecs/features/qt_functions.prf,
it seems the plugin gets a debug extension:

defineReplace(qtLibraryTarget) {
   unset(LIBRARY_NAME)
   LIBRARY_NAME = $$1
   mac:!static:contains(QT_CONFIG, qt_framework) {
      QMAKE_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_NAME = $$LIBRARY_NAME
      export(QMAKE_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_NAME)
   }
   contains(TEMPLATE, .*lib):CONFIG(debug, debug&#124;release) {
      !debug_and_release&#124;build_pass {
          mac:RET = $$member(LIBRARY_NAME, 0)_debug
   	      else:win32:RET = $$member(LIBRARY_NAME, 0)d
      }
   }
   isEmpty(RET):RET = $$LIBRARY_NAME
   return($$RET)
}

Looking at qpluginloader/theplugin/theplugin.pro, they had a related issue and replaced:
# Use a predictable name for the plugin, no debug extension. Just like most apps do.
#TARGET        = $$qtLibraryTarget(theplugin)
TARGET        = theplugin

That should be enough for us here (for info the related change in qtbase is sha1 418890e)

|Patch Set 2:

Thanks for this change Kai. Could you change quickcontrols to just controls?

The idea is to get the examples into:
examples/quick/controls alongside:

examples/quick/dialogs
examples/quick/window
...

So the structure is consistent with the installation:
qml/QtQuick/Controls
qml/QtQuick/Dialogs
qml/QtQuick/Windows
...

What do you think?

Hi.

I think this test failed because qtdeclarative stable-&gt;dev was not merged yet:
https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,59990

The problem is due to some tests functions not being skipped on mac because of https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,59673 (QQmlPlatform: rename &quot;mac&quot; to &quot;osx&quot;).

It should work now. I will give it a go.

With the V4 change, the error is now given in TestCase.qml:

It should be given in the file (was the case with V8):

|Patch Set 1:

Shawn, in qmlplugindump tool, I now excludes the properties/methods starting with &quot;__&quot;. So they won't be available for auto-completion qt Qt Creator:
https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,64594

Do the prop/methods starting with a single &quot;_&quot; need to be excluded? I thought the double &quot;__&quot; was the rule, but I am not 100% sure now.
|Patch Set 1:

I see the point and I don't disagree. But is that really necessary since in qml you can call a function whatever its access mode? Even if I set the functions access to Private, I can still call them from qml.

Also QMetaMethod has this access flag, but QMetaProperty doesn't if I am correct. So while we can set the access to protected/public for the methods depending on their names, the qmlplugindump tool would still need to check for the &quot;__&quot; when dealing with properties.

It seems that having the right access mode only makes sense in C++ not in qml. So I am just not sure that using the method access is a better approach than using the qmlplugindump tool to identify data available for autocompletion. Anything else I may be missing?

|Patch Set 2:

Actually what if we dump everything (i.e. even the prop/methods starting with &quot;__&quot;) and let Qt Creator add a different symbol/color for the prop starting with __. Something similar to what we have in C++ where all the prop are shown but when they are protected there is a little &quot;key&quot; in the symbol.

So for developers working with internal prop, they could still have auto-completion when then start typing &quot;__x&quot;. And the end user could &quot;see&quot; that they are not supposed to use those props.

What do you think?

If you have:

                id: cbItems
                ListElement { text: &quot;Banana&quot;; color: &quot;Yellow&quot; }
                ListElement { text: &quot;Apple&quot;; color: &quot;Green&quot; }

            }
        editable: true
        validator: RegExpValidator {regExp: /[a-zA-z]*/}

Because of autocompletion, you can never enter aaa or bbb because when entering a it is updated to A. 

Enter a then delete, enter a again the Apple appears.
(Entering aaa the first time works though)
|Patch Set 21: (6 inline comments)

Looking good!
One difference with QComboBox is when enter &quot;a&quot;, QComboBox autocomplete with &quot;apple&quot; (lower case a is not changed) and when enter is press, set value to &quot;Apple&quot;. ComboBox completes with &quot;Apple&quot; without pressing enter.

The problem arises for Label in qtquickcontrols which is a Text item.

About updating all plugins.qmltypes files just before release, I think that is a good idea so we make sure we don't forget anything.

It may still be nice though to update the files regularly when we think this is needed. This way we get the benefit of using a better auto-completion in qt creator and the chance to see some eventual problems.

For the plugin.qmltypes file, should we wait for that change:
https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,64594 ?

So it will add the composite types as well. We can still update the plugins.qmltypes again later if you want that in now though.

|Patch Set 12:

Some comments:
- Table with whatever selection mode: calling table.selection.selectAll() does select all.
- When using extended selection using shift + click. you can select between all the raws between 2 rows. that does not work for unselecting between 2 rows.
- when using multiple selection shift+click selected/deselect, as expected I guess.

Does not seem to be differences between extended and multile selections. Should extented select only consecutive rows?

Would it be possible to have both?
- since 5.1 / QtQuick.Controls 1.0
Or maybe a table somewhere that states which imports for which Qt version

i.e.
Qt 5.1
QtQuick.Controls 1.0
QtQuick 2.1
...

Qt 5.2
QtQuick.Controls 1.1
QtQuick 2.2
...

For the moment we only have 2 versions so it is easy to remember. But matching an import version with a Qt version may become laborious in the future.

I was looking atnthe test failure from:
https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,51948

This is strange, it should not be related. If the failure happens again , it may be a problem in the tests, no?
|Patch Set 2: No score

This is really scary. All the tests with keyPress are now failing. As if maybe the ApplicationWindow from the tst_applicationwindow was still there and &quot;catching&quot; the key press. I am not sure what's going on.

I had some weird problem within a single test but not accross tests. (https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-30523)

Can you reproduce the failures on Mac? (Shawn or Gabriel?) I can't on Windows.

If yes, would it help to add:

|Patch Set 4: (6 inline comments)

what about having the qrc path and local path as QString returned from a function? (similar to what we have in controls, 
So you would have QString getFileLocation(QString filename))

you could then add for example QString(&quot;Widget%1.qml&quot;).arg(qmlName) or with &quot;Default&quot; and use it for QString(&quot;qml/DefaultWindowDecoration.qml&quot;)

|Patch Set 5:

The flat style example doesn't work on iOS for 5.5.0 at the moment. I have chosen on purpose to use Q_OS_IOS only here because static builds in general are broken with QtQuick.

QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE is not documented and I thought it was an internal &quot;hack&quot; until we have in place a nice API to set a non default style at startup :) Using something like &quot;static__Flat__QtQuickExtrasFlatPlugin&quot; was the simplest solution I found to minimize the change, I am not sure how to get the plugin style name otherwise (to use with QPluginLoader)

Using &quot;#ifdef QT_STATIC&quot; is a good idea but does not give us enough info on which plugin to use. 

Note that iOS is not a &quot;common&quot; case for static build because we do ship the qmldir files inside the application bundle, so for iOS we can find them.

In generic static builds, the qmldir are missing and should be included in resources to be found. Andy is currently trying to fix static builds (see https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/111866/)

I do agree that this solution is not general enough, this change may just add on more complexity. But we don't have proper static builds and style set-up ready yet and I am not sure what's best to do at this stage. Maybe this is something we can discuss? :)
|Uploaded patch set 6.
|Patch Set 6:

I took into account JP's comments and made the change less iOS specific. Now check if QT_STATIC is defined and figure out the plugin's name based on the style name.

What is specific about the style plugin is that we want to use it instead of the default style. This must happen before any qml file is loaded. We may not even import it in a qml file, thus using QT_IMPORT_PLUGIN manualy is needed.

In the flat example, the example actually use import QtQuick.Controls.Style.Flat but there could be cases where we would load a style without importing it in any qml file. I have added QT_IMPORT_PLUGIN to make it more obvious in the example.

Note: The style plugin here is only used to include qml files in resources, the qmldir is empty. We use qml_plugin.qrf for the only sake of deploying it into a know qml import location.

|Patch Set 1:

I tested the change and now it's not setting the cell selected with arrow keys active after pressing space. Is this intentional? I find it odd that one would even have to press space to set the selection active after arrow key selection (compared, for example, to how 'Edit Colors' works in Paint).

|Patch Set 1:

Yes, multiaxis cases work in qmlchartaxis manual test, for example, the Series specific dynamic has two x and y axes.

The same change should work with handleAxisX/YTopSet because setAxisX() sets the same axis as addAxis(axis, Qt::AlignBottom) (same with setAxisY() and Qt::AlignLeft). Will modify that too accordingly.

Scene root is still selectable in some cases. If you first select scene root, press ctrl and select another item -&gt; item gets selected, then release ctrl and select scene root -&gt; item and scene root are selected.

|Patch Set 1:

The closed arrow is actually centered. It can be seen when compared to the focus rectangle for example. The texts (default ones) in the tree have characters which don't occupy the descent area (they only occupy the cap height area) and this makes it look like it's not centered.

|AFAICT the DEPLOYMENT qmake variable only works on Symbian or Windows CE.

Has this actually been tested on harmattan builds and shown to work?

What is supposed to happen is that either qt3dquick_pkg_dep.pri or qt3d_pkg_dep.pri is supposed to set the icons.files variable to the appropriate value.  Then in pkg.pri icons.path is set and icons itself is added to the INSTALLS var.
|Will this apostrophe terminate the string started at '&lt;br&gt; on line 85, and cause a syntax error, or other problem?
|Suggest avoiding the double-negative:

    This is useful in the case where multiple cameras are used.
|What will happen when the scene is first rendered and the fbo has not yet had any content rendered into it?  Or is it colour filled or something?

Do you get a recursion thing happening?  If this is still an open issue maybe restructure the example to avoid dealing with it right now.  Otherwise make some mention of it.
|This file looks like its been checked in mistakenly.

This directory &quot;Qt3DQuick&quot; does not exist in my source control, and I think it is created by the syncqt process, so its a generated file.

This is most likely caused as a result of not doing shadow builds, so therefore build artefacts have gotten into your check in.
|Unfortunately this is already the name of a class from QML: try googling for QDeclarativeAnimation and you'll see what I mean.

Suggest using a similar name that has the string &quot;3D&quot; in it somewhere.
|Since this function does not need any member or class information, it does not even need to be a static member.

Suggest it just be:

    static inline qNotifyItemsRecursive(QQuickItem* pItem, QOpenGLContext* pContext)
    {
        // implementation
    }

See &quot;Prefer non-member non-friend functions&quot; Effective C++ 3rd Ed by Meyers Item 23, Pg 98 for more.
|Is this level argument actually used for anything?  Maybe it was used in debug printout, but I don't see it used at present.
|See comment in .cpp file about removing this from the header, and making this just a local helper.
|This macro logic looks a bit brittle.  Suggest some more parens, or break it up over more lines.
|Comment style should match the rest of the file.
|whitespace!
|Maybe we should just make all of these

   directory: [&quot;qml&quot;]

Since we should never have any qml files or attendant resources in the directory above the qml directory.  Except for the wrapper anyway.

Removing an element from this list means that load times are quicker because the search is not stat'ing and checking as much.  I suggest trying an strace of the two options to see the difference.
|In the more general case we should in Qt5 be using signal spy for this.  Doc is in

    qtdeclarative/src/imports/testlib/signalspy.qdoc

for getting things ported over and working, yes just do what is needed.  Longer term signal spy is better than creating all these properties ourselves.
|OK, this is a reasonable start to the rotation, but in the original app you could set a rotation value for X, Y or Z independently.

This is termed Euler angles, and is a popular way of doing this, even though it results in gimbal lock.

This ability to only set one angle and choose one of the three axes seems to be missing something.
|Suggest a brief comment explaining what this limit switch does.  Since ValueField is a re-useable component, this effectively forms part of the API of it, and &quot;limit&quot; doesn't really tell you.
|Maybe its because of the awkward ternary operator?

In any case you could just require that ValueFields *always* have a label.  This seems reasonable.

Even more reasonable, when you note that the only field in the app when you run it that does not have a label is scale, and in fact you should be able to scale differently in the X, Y and Z directions.

In the original modelviewer from the research repo, you could click a &quot;lock&quot; button to make the scale values all move together or change independently.

Why exactly is it denied to the user to be able to change the X, Y and Z scale?
|This comment could be more informative that the x 1 is actually doing a &quot;javascript string to int cast&quot;
|Suggest some more comments here.

Explain which is the top-left, top-right and bottom-right viewports, and what aspect of the model they are displaying.

Generally these code files are a bit light on comments.
|Back-tab doesn't work.  That is I can tab forward through the fields but the only way to get back to a previous field is I have to take my fingers off the keyboard and use the mouse.
|These controls look good and have improved the UI quite a bit.

The values in the fields fill up with far too much precision size.  This makes the resulting value hard to read and difficult to assess as you increase or decrease.
|At some point this needs to be made more modular and setup for unit testing.

Its OK as a start.
|The brace for the opening of this function should be on the next line, I think.  The Qt coding style guide agrees with me:

http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qtcreator-extending/coding-style.html#braces
|As per sanity bot this should be

    if (!file.open(....))
|Its not just about display - QML also uses these for updating values that are derived from this.  So if you have some javascript which does something programatically with the value of filename, then it won't pick up any changed value, AFAICT.

It might not matter, right now, but the proper notify signals should be added otherwise there will probably be hard to diagnose bugs down the track.
|Not so important since this is a desktop application, but the umbrella includes pull in a lot of headers that are not needed.  As a rule just use the headers that are needed.
|Still seeing this disembodied camera text in the UI which does not seem to relate to anything.
|This blank effect seems to result in the target app in the model losing its materials.

Suggest leaving this out of the generated QML, and app developers can add it in to a outer scope if needed
|This is quite distracting - I get all my fields &quot;selected&quot; - that is highlighted in blue - when I tab through.

Obviously only the one with focus gets edited, but it is hard to see which one has the focus with all highlighted.

Also - as sanity bot points out below should be

   onFocusChanged: if (focus == true) selectAll(); else select(0,0)

or even better:

    onFocusChanged: {
        if (focus) {
            selectAll();
        } else {
            select(0,0);
        }
    }
|This seems to work around your &quot;no negative values in the scale&quot; logic, so dragging the mouse with middle button pressed results in negative values.

As sanity bot says these should have a space.

     else if (mouseDown === Qt.MiddleButton)

I do like the pattern of wrapping the onMouseXChanged: handler in curly braces tho, rather than squeezing if &amp; else on one line.
|Something a bit more traditional in the way of titles for help dialogs would be good:

    s/Apparently you're having problems/ModelTweaker Help/

&quot;&lt;app title&gt; Help&quot;  for example.
|s/dragging with/dragging will/
|These changes are not reflected in the commit messages.

What do they do?
|I think you want 

    QFileDialog::getSaveFileName(...) 

...since this one does not allow you to type in a name to save the file under.  You can only save it over an already existing filename.
|The grey-on-grey is a bit tough on the tired eyes.  The black text becomes hard to read.

Needs a bit of color.  Suggest searching the internet for some good UI color schemes.  Orange or &quot;burly wood&quot; might work for button background color.
|Hmm - this code looks a bit brittle, with the use of QUrl here, and its confusing (by which I mean it could use some more inline doco to explain what it is supposed to do).

I suspect you might need to do

    QFileInfo fi(_filename);
    QString modelFileName = fi.canonicalFilePath();

...since with the other one you don't know for sure if its absolute, you could get a relative path there.

Ok, so basically you just use the _filename to get the location of the current file so you can make a relative path to it.

So you probably want to put that into your getSaveFileName dialog as the third argument.

Also - with coding style again:  I prefer 

    QString m_filename;

This is fine, as long as its consistent in the app.
|OK - so the lock image is added but not wired up yet?

Might want to mention that in the submit message.
|Not sure why this line was removed.
|Maybe:

     valueSlider.update(text)
|It's actually now 

    	https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/quick3d

...should change it.
|This looks sufficient for the method documentation.

You should mention the need for the context to be current and the fact that if its not a warning is printed.

Suggest maybe mentioning this in the class level documentation.

We can improve documentation in a second pass.
|You can also use the qPrintable() macro for this.  But this is fine.
|This looks OK - can also look at void QSGPainterNode::updateGeometry() where the InvertedYFramebufferObject is set.  Same sort of approach.

I guess since you have your own QSGGeometry subclass you'll always have to track what ever changes SG does underneath your FBO usage.
|I wonder if seeking back to 0 is correct here.  What if the device was at some offset in say a zip file stream?

I guess the original code assumes 0 anyway, so it is at least better than that.  Let's go with this, and see how unit tests on all platforms go via CI.
|OK - so this deals with the message mentioned in previous review.

It's good to fix this problem.  What exactly is the problem however?  Explain this in the commit message, and how the fix addresses it.

DEPLOYMENT is a Symbian thing: http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/qmake-variable-reference.html#deployment

...or at least as far as I know.  I suspect this is not doing what you think it is.

Anyway I would rather the existing mechanism with pkg.pri was fixed, instead of working around it.  The other comment.

I suspect the problem is that qt3dquick_pkg_dep.pri includes qt3d_pkg_dep.pri and the icon is getting set to the wrong thing.

Try debugging it by running qmake -d ...  to see what it is actually doing.

|Patch Set 3: Do not submit

The right thing to do is remove all support from Qt3D for the TGA image format and use the patches that were put into Qt.

Somehow these did not get into Qt5, or worse these qt3d ones are over-writing the Qt base ones.  

If there are still unit test failures at that point, then they can be fixed.

Hi 

Looks pretty good so far, and on the right track.  Couple of things to fix.
|Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Abandoned in favour of 16366
|Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Please resubmit against qt/qt3d:qt4

The patch itself looks good but it should be submitted against the qt4 branch of the qt/qt3d repo.  That is the correct place for this to hit our main development line for Qt 4.8.

This repo qt/quick3d now just consists of a README telling you to use qt/qt3d - http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/quick3d/trees/master - so this patch wouldn't integrate anyway.

Thanks for the submission.

This change is included in http://codereview.qt-project.org/19506 - see the bug number referenced in that change for the rationale and the importance of doing the complete change, since the deprecation mechanism will shortly go away and the header changes will not then be enough.

Thanks for prodding us to get 19506 pushed thru tho.  :-)

I don't have time right now to run this up on a device and check a) that the unit tests pass, and b) that it is actually faster than -O2.  But assuming that has been done I'm fine with it.

Hmmm - this didn't seem to do the trick, even tho' these tests passed locally when I cherry-picked your changes locally and used the same configure line.

Change looks good, thanks, but a http://bugreports.qt-project.org issue number should be referenced with the:

    Task-number: 

field completed in the commit message.  That bug report should mention what actual issue this is fixing, especially since this is actually changing the behaviour.  Also if there is a real issue being fixed the unit tests should be added to, so that any regressions are caught.

This is a good start.  It's good to do it in QML as far as possible, and the structure looks good.

However I strongly suggest that to go back and just try to get one of the use cases working properly - that is with numerical entry, slider and dragging in the viewport, all linked together.  Just having numerical entry seems wrong, and the way the dragging does not change the display is confusing.

Maybe rotation would be a good place to start.  You could have 3 sliders for rotation around each of the 3 axes, or maybe knobs.  If you drag the model, it moves the sliders, and updates the numbers; and vice-versa.

When it comes to position, you could have a mode change - eg holding down control and dragging, or sliding the sliders, makes the position get updated.  You could have a mode indicator on the display so that when you depress the control key it switches from &quot;rotation&quot; to &quot;position&quot;.

The 3 pane view is effective enough as far as it goes.

But it is very hard to tell from a user perspective what you are seeing.

You need a reference plane here so that it is obvious what each of the 3 perspectives is showing you.

Also some sort of labelling in the UI would be good, eg &quot;Top down view&quot;, &quot;View from Right Side&quot;, and &quot;View from Front&quot;.

Another tab niggle - relates the size of the fields contents which probably only need 2 or 3 places of decimals - when you tab to a new field it is really painful to replace the values set by the + or - buttons with text because you have to backspace over the whole lot.

When you tab into a field the contents should be selected by default so that typing automatically replaces what is there.

This looks really good from a functionality point of view, succinct and gets the job done.

Suggest to address the review comments and make a new patchset.

Also I recommend thinking ahead to when this could be unit tested, and put the functionality in to .cpp file, so that you have room to add documentation for the function signatures.

This will help when you get to writing unit tests.  For example, what will happen if the filename is set to the null string?  If the answer is &quot;behavior is undefined&quot; then you get to say that, rather than just getting the default of whatever the QFile::open(...) function happens to do with an empty string.

Looks fine.

The smaller number of places in the edit boxes is good.

Dragging works well.

Scroll wheel would be a good thing to implement.

This works well.

As per other work items would be good to have some hint that you need to hold down the control key to get rotation.

Many people will probably find it by experimenting (as I did).

Create a bug to track down this wacky focus issue.  Maybe the declarative guys can help.

In general +1 to Danny's comments, both about the buttons and the transitions.

This is really good for a start and I love the way the 3-pane UI is coming together, its working really well now.

But the black on grey button does not really look like a button at first.  Even making it orange on grey would be better, but also with a surrounding round-rect so it looks more &quot;click-able&quot;.

These &quot;sliders&quot; do work pretty well, tho' I was confused at first because I am used to 'slider' meaning a knob thing that, well, slides.

But this is easy to discover how it works by clicking on it.

Tab seems a bit broken, and its tricky at first to get it to give up focus - clicking outside the &quot;slider&quot; does not work.

Incremental improvement - lets see what comes next.

|Patch Set 1:

Looking back at this there are a couple of clunky things with the writing of the file that should have been picked up in earlier reviews.  The right way to write out a text file is to open a QTextStream:

    QFile qmlFile(fileName);
    if (qmlFile.open(QIODevice::WriteOnly))
    {
        QTextStream os(&amp;qmlFile);
        os &lt;&lt; data;
        qmlFile.close():
    }

Also the line where debug output is done:

    qDebug(&quot;This was the file name %s&quot;, qPrintable(fileName));

or better:

    qDebug() &lt;&lt; &quot;This was the file name:&quot; &lt;&lt; fileName;

This last one needs to be protected by 

    #ifndef QT_NO_DEBUG_STREAM
    // ...
    #endif

Great start and looking good so far.  Good progress!

The fragment and vertex shader files and the projective textures stuff comes from Julians work?  Maybe just make some mention of where this comes from and why its named as it is.  If its not actually doing a projective texture function as such in your example here then it could get a new name perhaps.

Also some other niggly suggestions below to look at before the +2 comes.

The commit message should look like:

    QGLSceneNode recursive child-node cloning

    Task-number: QTBUG-23299

So there *has* to be a short summary (less than 72 characters) with a blank line immediately after, and then when you quote the bug number it *must* be in the funky special format as shown, including the colon, and one space after it.

See this one for example:  http://codereview.qt-project.org/11578

Notice how gerrit turns the QTBUG into a hyperlink, whilst the one above is not.

Rohan's point is valid, but we don't have any explicit requirement on TGA coming from any package, and if folks are using it then they can work around by holding back the version until qtbase is available.

Looks fine.  Would like some more eyes across this before pushing.

A bit mind numbing - our examples do a lot of things that probably we should not be recommending folks actually do, for example the cube house thing trying to get N900 accelerometer data from the raw device with a QFile.  Ouch.

I think for now this works for C++ examples and we deal with bugs if they show up.

I just wonder if it really does fix the bug that it refers to.  I think there are broader issues with the direct rendering that need fixing still.

Maybe just alter the commit message to reflect that more fixes are coming.

Looks fine.  The addition of the Qt3D to headers doesn't seem to be part of this change somehow, but I guess it doesn't hurt.

Moving away from flipping via a scale by 1, -1, 1 is good because that potentially messes with lots of things - maybe winding, and normals for example.

Looks good, but the commit message needs a minor fix or so - then it gets +2 from me.  

((( See http://codereview.qt-project.org/20068 or most other changes to see how to format the Task-number: field so that it gets picked up by the auto-cross-referencing.  Also the header line for the commit must be short, and separated from the body of the commit message by a blank line. )))

This fix has actually been done at least once before but somehow never made it into this branch.

If feeling particularly civic minded it would be nice to check &amp; fix the unit tests which apparently didn't pick this up.

Suggest as a general policy trying to make sure that commits only depend on others when that really is the case.  Here the commits appear to be independent, and the dependency is purely because they are on top of each other in the working set at the time of the push.

OK, sure.

I wish people would shadow build though, since its building in the same directory as your sources that causes this problem.

OK, sure - but folks should not be building inside the source checkout.

http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qt3d-1.0/qt3d-building.html - shadow building is always preferred.

There is a never-ending list of build artefacts that changes every time some detail of the build alters, and this approach is always going to be playing catchup.

Builds fine, tests all pass.

Not sure if its this change or the previous one (on which this depends) but these warnings appear in qmake output:

Project WARNING: Use load(qt_build_config) instead of load(qt_module).
Project WARNING: CONFIG+=module is obsolete. load(qt_module_config) is sufficient.

Looks good.

We should probably also create a Jira bug to track this.

I'd like to see this tested on all the various platforms, hence have copied Julian in as reviewer.

This is needed work tho' as much of the packaging intent here harks back to 4.x days when multiple device targets were supported.  qtc_harmattan should probably go as well...

This code could really do with some documentation.

Suggest taking the time to at least do some very brief documentation before checking it in.

It will very quickly become lost as to why and how, and documenting now is going to be a lot easier than doing it later.
|Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)

Hi Sergey, I tried compiling this on my Windows laptop and I get the same error message as per the CI box - so this issue will need to be fixed before this change goes in.

As I suggest below the easiest way is to switch to using QList instead.
|Perhaps this should be transferFrom() or transferFromModel() to make it more obvious that it transfers items from (not to) another model.
|It seems best of the link name is the same as the title that it links to, i.e. it should be just &quot;\l {QML Application Developer Resources}&quot;. Though, that title doesn't really fit here, so I wonder if the page is correctly titled? E.g. how about changing &quot;QML Application Developer Resources&quot; to &quot;Creating Apps with QML&quot;? That might be a better fit for this set of links, as well as the one in mainpage.qdoc.
|That sounds like a good approach too. Some of the quick/ tests crash on exit (in the scenegraph renderer somewhere) if there are test cases that haven't deleted the created windows, so it's definitely worth the clean up.

Could you add more details to the commit message and/or comments to the classes to the explain the roles of the new classes?

Is it possible to split the commit into smaller separate patches or are they all intertwined? (It would make it easier to understand the different parts)

explicitSizeValue -&gt; explicitViewSizeValue
|Patch Set 4: Abandoned

This would be convenient but also raises a number of issues. For example, the user would probably expect the contentItem to automatically resize for any future change to childrenRect, which is unnecessarily expensive. Also, once contentWidth/Height is explicitly changed, then the Flickable should no longer automatically resize to its children, but this change in behaviour may be confusing. It seems better for the user to explicitly set up and tear down any necessary bindings in this case.

I agree, the patch needs to fix the section structure properly instead of simply removing the subsection structure. The existing &quot;JavaScript Host Environment&quot; should be reduced to a subsection and we should have a new topic page that covers this page as well as the QML Global Object page and the List of JavaScript Functions. Would you have any suggestions for a better overarching topic title than &quot;JavaScript Host Environment&quot;? (Alternatively, the existing  &quot;JavaScript Host Environment&quot; page could be renamed to something else so we can use it as the topic title.)

I think the ListModel argument passing is a fairly important part of the threaded scripting support. If it can't be done at the moment then maybe have a task for it so it's not forgotten.

If WorkerScript is being deprecated / no longer recommended due to this solution, this could be noted in the docs for WorkerScript.

Also, QTBUG-16735 could be in the task numbers for this change.

Since the images are now grouped with non-qml-related images, should they all have a &quot;qml-&quot; prefix? I noticed that is done for most other images in the doc/src/images directory.
|Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

That's true, so I'm not sure why there are qml-* and declarative-* images under qtdoc/doc/src/images.

In any case, this change looks fine, then.

Changes since the patch in animation-refactor:
- Fixed crash when accessing ViewTransition.item without starting the relevant transition
- Fixed QQuickItemViewPrivate::transitionNextReposition() to cancel running transitions to fix item layout issues when e.g. the add transition was set but not the addDisplaced transition
- Fixed to use populate transition on model reset

Fixed qtqml.qdocconf.

Fixed license headers. (They were incorrect because I'd copied them in from an older repo, as I couldn't find the qml-extending-types directory anywhere in the git history for qt5/qtdeclarative. I assume these snippets have not changed much since they were first created.)

Moved all content from qml/doc/new into qml/doc/src and moved qml/doc/new/main.qdoc to qml/doc/src/qtqml.qdoc to become the new module index page. The same has been done for qtquick. However the index pages still have to be fixed to correctly refer to the C++ class lists.

Sub-topic pages have been moved into their own directories and renamed appropriately. E.g. all document-* pages under have been moved into a &quot;document&quot; subdirectory and had their &quot;document-*&quot; prefix removed.

Some content still has to be merged into the new documentation. These have been placed into todo/ directories. (Some of this content has been partially merged already.)

|Patch Set 5:

As discussed, the built examples don't run on Mac since the .qml files are not accessible to the executable. Maybe it's worth going with the qrc solution since that's what we've done with some of the examples (e.g. modelviews/abstractitemmodel).

We could stow the the .qrc, main.cpp and launcher .qml files in a separate subdirectory (e.g. animation_launcher?) to avoid clutter. I suppose this might be an appropriate location for the .qdoc file as well if we end up needing to put that in a separate file.

Chris, what do you think of having the &quot;Important Concepts&quot; section before the &quot;QtQuick Module Documentation&quot; section? It's not consistent with how the QtQml index page is laid out, but it also seems like it would be odd if it were to be switched around to have the &quot;Important Concepts&quot; section later.

These doc changes follow the current internal documentation conventions in QtQuick that were brought into the source code long ago. It looks like some work needs to be done to make the qdoc documentation and the uses of the \qml* commands in the QtQuick documentation consistent with one another. In the meantime, we should make sure all the docs in QtQuick use the same conventions.

would do, no need for lines 322-323
|My though was that if there are other mingw build commands available (than mingw32-make) this would work then also, it just searches for the (sub)string 'mingw' from the MAKE_CMD.

Ok, I didn't realize that, so the downside of this change is that user is able to enter shorter number, but I have the feeling that this demo is not so much about demoing calculations with very long numbers, but more of the creating the UI and that stuff. But at the end of the day it's up to you, reviewers, whether you accept this or not :).

I don't have any strong opinions where they should be, one suggestion was to put it here since it's packaging related.
|Patch Set 3:

Ok, I can move these to testconfig.

About having one template for whole qt5 packaging, currently we have the packaging splitted to smaller steps: src package, binary build and installer creation. The benefit of that is that we can re-build just the binaries or just the installer, which will save lot of time. Afaik we would like to keep it that way (unless Iikka has other opinion) which will require several templates for Jenkins.

Well, maybe, but what are the disadvantages? This all could be done in inline script section on Bamboo, but when it's done by script we can easily extend the functionality (e.g. handle .zip file) later if needed, having a script is more version controlled.

So, there is no support for -j or -s options? -j could be useful at this point, when we need to do re-runs, saves some time.

Originally -j12 was hard coded, then I added variables for those, which were then changed to MAKEARGS, and now there is none, is that how we want it?

I thinks it's more clear when they are in different files (one ini file for defining the jobs and other for defining the nodes to build the jobs), the file size doesn't grow so big making it easier to find when you need to update something.

So, unless this structure is very unpractical and unusefull I would like to keep it this way. But if the common opinion is that it's better have just one ini file, I'll combine these.

Unnecessary. No dependencies here
|I removed the qrc prefix as when this module is used in launcher it is not compiled and qrc cannot be used there. This way png's can be used either from resources (e.g. Windows ) or from file system (e.g. b2qt launcher in embedded)
|Done
|Done
|Kimmo was able to reproduce the issue too, fix is now in.
|Well then git blame is lying. Anyway, this has worked at least in the few devices we have used and in desktop but I can remove the hard coded values, no problem.
|Well didn't you specify these to virtual keyboard demo, you should know  ;-). This is a copy of it.
|Of course!
|Sorry I forgot to mention that you need also update to launcher, checkout https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/144747/
|Webengine is replaced with webbrowser. qt5-everywhere is a demo which contains demos that why it is removed, intention is at some point to bring the demos inside it to the top level (Sami Makkonen and Diana de Sousa made the decision)
Other demos that got removed had 'exclude: all' already previously set, so no point in keeping those in repository and pushing to devices.
|Done
|You are right :-). Sorry my bad English.
|removeFirst() does not return the list but otherwise a working solution.
|Preferably I would like the 'old' implementation back to QProcess, that in Windows you could start process with empty arguments when using setNativeArguments().
|Thanks Kai. 
Do you have suggestions how this should be fixed? As cmd.exe requires the use of setNativeArguments(), we cannot pass the parameters in QProcess::start().

From QProcess::start() doc:
&quot;Windows: The arguments are quoted and joined into a command line that is compatible with the CommandLineToArgvW() Windows function. For programs that have different command line quoting requirements, you need to use setNativeArguments(). One notable program that does not follow the CommandLineToArgvW() rules is cmd.exe and, by consequence, all batch scripts.&quot;

Should we allow calling setNativeArguments() directly from script before execute -operation?
|This is better, but it still gives a warning if another installer with the same name is started (not the same installer) because now  all installers uses the same lock file. However, the warning is only seen in when run verbose because of this runchec.isRunning check here. I don't mind this as this solution is way better than it was before, but I would change the the comment above this as it is no longer valid.
|ah, there is an assert when trying to set model to item based itemview.
|Otherwise looks good, but should we check here if the QAbstractitemView is item based? As if you set model to for example QListWidget, then this will probably crash.
|True, that would happen if the throw was catched. But this should be done in a different commit as it is not related to this fix, errors are thrown also elsewhere in this method.
|This is callback for download for the compressed item, it is not decompressed yet. In this method we start the decompress task for downloaded compress file.
|I was trying to keep the changes consistence, this is how it is done also in the parseUpdatesXml() method. If warning is wanted instead of debug then we need to change it to the other place too in a different commit.
|This is also for consistence, checkout above method
|Yes. But what  should the text itself actually be? Not very good to say 'repositories/files'
|No. Other command line parser error messages are not tr() either. If that is wanted, then separate commit to fix all.
|How about removing this and modifying qSetMessagePattern() so that relevant information would be printed without having to set QT_MESSAGE_PATTERN

Otherwise looking good except when running maintenancetool, the previous log is overwritten when installing to admin directory. Do you have a reason for that?
|Patch Set 2:

Yes, only when installing to admin dir. For me it uses connectToServer() which opens the data stream as WriteOnly - maybe that is the reason. But this is already unrelated to this feature you are implementing now.

WIP, this is not finished and needs improving but should allow signing maintenancetool without breaking any functionality. Just sign installer.exe you created with binarycreator and maintenancetool should be signed too without the need to deploy maintenancetool separately.

Normally the repository items are not compressed. As bsp packages are, they need to be decompressed first. So what we do here is that we download the compressed file and decompress it to temp folder. If we don't decompress in this stage, installer does not notice if there are updates available. Note that the content is not decompressed yet.
After that the bsp repository install happens like in 'normal' repository package - when the actual install begins, we decompress the content.
|Patch Set 4:

Ok, now I get it. As the package cannot be downloaded from server we don't need to download it to tmp folder and decompress it from there. Instead we can extract it from where it was downloaded already.

|Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1
|The unstable test function always seems to be QSKIP'ed in CI (at least in pulse run ranges 730-829 and 870-969). So the instability is unproblematic to CI. In other execution environments, the problem might still arise, so QTBUG-21100 still applies on those cases. Haven't reproduced it myself, though.
|Whitespace-only change that seems to be irrelevant to the overall change.

|Whitespace-only change that seems to be irrelevant to the overall change.
|This case is already handled in findPartitionDefinitions() (a list with a single item is returned). findPartitionDefinitions() returns an empty list to indicate an unrecoverable error condition.
|How can it fail? If defaultSpecified is true at this point, it is set as a result of the current partition being marked as default, so it should be fine to reset defaultSpecified to false. (More precisely: if defaultSpecified was true because of an earlier partition, the current partition wouldn't be allowed to be default (see code path a few lines above), so we wouldn't even enter this if-block in the first place.)

I agree with Rohan. The '#include &lt;...&gt;' form seems to be far more common than '#include &quot;...&quot;' for Qt headers (private as well as public) in both tests and in the Qt source itself. I guess it ought to be a coding style convention (if it isn't already).

|Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Tick counts can be thought of as a high resolution alternative to the default QTimer-based measurer. Both are sensitive to the same system instabilities (both include system calls - in contrast to callgrind). I can't see any problems using a minimum accumulated time of 50 milliseconds for both. (Note that callgrind should still accept any measurement (i.e. always return true in isMeasurementAccepted()) since it is expected to generate the same number when repeated).

I would still like to check with Morten Sorvig - the original integrator of the CPU ticks feature.

Note that this is a two-step move operation. The first commit deletes qtipc from qtbase while the second commit re-introduces qtipc in qtscript.

The second commit must await final merge of the first commit so that it can refer to the SHA-1 in the commit message.

Note that the whitespace issues reported by the sanity bot were already present in this code when it lived in qtbase, so the overall amount of trailing/leading whitespace in Qt does not increase by this change.

I suggest we ignore them for now and instead clean them up later together with whitespace issues elsewhere.

|Probably, it's better to relay on default value.
|Would rename objects to mapItems
|all code related to ItemMarker needs to be removed
|That's good idea to handle signals widthChanged and HeightChanged
|We do not have MouseGeoArea.
|What is the point to have 2 almost identical menu? I would have one menu for all mouse buttons. Having &quot;Delete all items&quot; and &quot;Delete all markers&quot; is a bit confusing. Would not it be more intuitive to have just one  &quot;Delete all objects&quot; menu item?
|Timer has to be removed as we got onPressAndHold now.
|darkgray is the same color as darkgrey. I am updating entire color theme and images to look better on devices, so replacing darkgray with darkgrey  are not really important.
|Agree with this corrections.
|We do not have these methods yet, needs to be commented out
|There is no ItemMarker class and it seems ItemMarker is intended to duplicate Marker functionality. We do not need to have duplicates, suggesting to remove all code related to ItemMarkers.
|It is better to place pinch and flick settings inside MapComponent.qml
|Can plugin's set of Map Types be changed on fly? Is not it predefined values?
|It is better to have infoLabel inside MapComponents.qml and we do not need signal itemInfo, we can use binding infolabel.opacity: (infoText.text == &quot;&quot;) ? 0 : 0.8
|Needs to be removed as we do not need ItemMarker
|Needs to be removed as we do not need ItemMarker
|Needs to be removed as we do not need ItemMarker
|Why did you update the licence?
|Would not it be better to have testRequirements filled instead of having this comment?
|Do you have source code of the test app in private repo?
|Do you have any other test groups? I think, that would be sensible to add more groups based on SW release version. For example 1.2, 5.0...
|Can you perform this test on simulator?
|I think, initTestCase can be removed without any harm
|Do you need to pass these arguments (extension, filename,format)? They are not used in test at all.
|Patch Set 1: Abandoned
|Patch Set 3: Do not submit

qtlocation module already contains flickr, landmarkmap and mapviewer applications. They are placed in examples/declarative.
mapsdemo was renamed to maps in qt5/qtlocation/examples. We do not need another copy of mapsdemo in qtlocation.

Daniel, I am not sure why did you replace testApplication with  testTitle? I think, we should follow our agreement http://wikis.in.nokia.com/QtQualityEngineering/QtQualEngSystemTestCodingStyleGuide.

Can't you indicate testSource for your tests? Is test app in a private repo?

Looks good. I just have 2 questions. Do you have feature number (Jira item) for tested code? Are your tests related to new qt5 code? If yes, doesn't it have sense to indicate one more group, like testGroups = &quot;BAT,5.0&quot;.

Patch 3: fixed license issue. There are 2 folders now for each project: mapviewer and mapviewerwrapper. Mapviewer is pure qml project and mapviewerwrapper allows us to get executable file. Mapviewer is not usable now, I planned to work with it on next step. I'll also review visual elements and it's size when I get app running on a device. Thank you, Michal for pointing out that some sizes can be too small. I also have intention to  keep kind of &quot;mobile devices&quot; style, so main menu/&quot;button row&quot; is placed at the bottom of the screen.

1) GeocodeModel is still commented out in MapComponent.qml, so geocodeDialog and reverseGeocodeDialog do not return results. 
2) Please rebase your code, we have popup menu now
|Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I am not sure why we had geocodemodel in mapviewer.qml. Previously MapComponent provided geocodemodel and pointdelegate as well, so we had a circle representing our point. The idea was to move map center in case geocoding/revgeocoding is successful and draw a circle. I think, it is better to remove geocodemodel from mapviewer and use mapcomponent's one.
|Patch Set 2: No score

Another point: geocodemodel should use map's plugin, it should not be hardcoded as we can switch between plugins now.

This fix proposal doesn't take into account that there is no ShapeBounding defined on Solaris. And it also fails if -no-xshape option is set in configure.

With -no-xshape set, one gets these errors:
&quot;kernel/qdnd_x11.cpp&quot;, line 1429: Error: The function &quot;XShapeGetRectangles&quot; must have a prototype.
&quot;kernel/qdnd_x11.cpp&quot;, line 1472: Error: ShapeBounding is not defined.
2 Error(s) and 5 Warning(s) detected.

There needs to be a check for #if defined QT_NO_XSHAPE around the windowInteractsWithPosition() function.

The implementation there is at the moment is working on Solaris, but #if defined QT_NO_XSHAPE must be added around the function mentioned previously, since the proposed fix hasn't been tested with -no-xshape, it would fail if XShape is not available.

Before this can be merged it needs to be figured out how to workaround the binary break (which was chosen to be accepted) in between Qt 5.6.0 and Qt 5.6.1 to make the test passing.

Thinking it more thoroughly, why not to add those files? I think it's equally important to maintain the binary compatibility between the patch releases as with the minor releases. It might be that I'm missing something here, but could someone shed light on the matter?

|Patch Set 2:

A chat with Simon proved that he and Frederik are right. It's not a textual comparison like I thought, but it parses the class output instead. So, there's no need to update the data files to the patch releases. It does suffice to compare to the x.x.0 release.

I have updated the commit and start pushing the data files for other modules also.

I don't know if we can remove lineCount completely, since windows was earlier blacklisted for it. I would say a more correct thing to do would be to do is:

[Text::test_linecount]		
windows

and just remove the 'osx' from it.

Mitch: Those EOFs indicate that the test has crashed.
|Patch Set 8:

It would be good if it spitted a crash log, yes. I've tried to reproduce this many many times on the CI machines, but I've never seen the test crash.
|Patch Set 8:

One thing that is hoped to increase the stability of (any) OpenGL related tests is this commit: https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/170519/

but it requires thishttps://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/174719/ to be in first. This canvas3d change is already in 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8, but it needs to be in dev also.

But if that what Mitch says is true, I don't think those help to solve the issue though...

If we were able to reproduce this, it would be great. Or else if we got a decent crash log from it, rather than some Error: unexpected EOF. It would need to be implemented to Coin however, but does Friedemann have an idea how to get crash dumps from Windows?

|Should all other metadata values be converted with toString before inserting to object?
|Uniqueness to access constraints instead of hard coding
|Detail field not detail type
|I'd prefer MissingMandatoryDeetailFieldError
|I'm asking to create clear rules about when an item (or collection) is valid, documenting them and also changing the implementation to reflect the rules. I don't think rules should contain anything which requires cross-checking between items, such as checking if a collection really exists in data base or checking if the parent of an occurrence really exists.
|What does a valid item mean in the context of this function? Is of supported item type, has only supported detail types, contains all mandatory fields, cardinality of details is correct? Some cross-checking between detail fields: if one field is present then the other must be too? Something else?
|qCritical could be added to explain what requirement is missing.
|I don't like having friendship between request thread and engine. I also think maybe this whole check could be removed from this function, because this kind of cross-referencing checks are done when handling save request and remove request (and maybe could be added to fetch requests too). Or if we check that the collection really exists, should we also check for occurrences that the parent item really exists, etc? We need to scope validation functions carefully and also document that.
|Should we utilize here supportedItemTypes function?
|It might be a good idea to use supportedItemDetails to find out allowed details for a item type instead of hard coding them. Also mandatoriness and uniqueness information would be nice to have in a table where it would be easy to read and maintain. However, in this function performance is the priority, so some hardcoding is ok if it's more efficient than using tables and functions...
|Detail field can be mandatory and it of course implies that a detail can also be mandatory, but should the error code be rather MissingMandatoryDetailFieldError?
|Validation of a collection or an item should be possible without accessing the data base and checking the items there. Validation should only be about the &quot;format&quot; of the collection, no cross-checking between collections in data base and the collections which is being validated. Otherwise it would be really hard to draw the line, which part of the validation belongs to validate function and which part to handling of save request. E.g. in item save request there is a huge amount of different cross-checks between items, parent items, and collections, which really cannot be part of the validation function.
|This check could be removed from this function and added to handling of collection save request.
|Yep, there should not be any qDebugs in the code.
|For validation when fetching: fetch occurrence request sometimes fetches items from db (if include exceptions flag is true in internalOccurrences function). Fetch by id request does not use internalItems function, instead it accesses m_storage directly, so it needs to be handled separately.
|I don't like this friendship, please see more comments in jsondb engine class.
|Please read the comments for the previous patch. updateMaxItemsCount should not be called from this function. maxItemCountChanged should be connected to doUpdateItems slot. There is no reason to invent new mechanism for checking autoUpdate, because we already have doUpdateItems function where it is done.
|Good points. I considered making the whole class static, but decided not to because then all functions in the class (also private) would have had to be static... I keep it in mind and maybe change them in the future.
|The value of the string should be upper case (&quot;ANNIVERSARY&quot;), if we want to follow http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#page-147, see 5.7.
|Property declarations should be the first thing in the object (because this object does not have id). Signal declarations should be right after them.
|Delete functionality could be moved to event edit page.

|Done in &quot;Adapt organizer to the new QtJsonDb API&quot; patch.
|Done in &quot;Adapt organizer to the new QtJsonDb API&quot; patch.
|Some typos in this sentence?
|The order of parameters could be the same as in c++: start, end, maxCount, sortOrders (not sortList), fetchHint, storageLocation.
|Another fetchItems function without start and end dates might be useful, if the user does not want to give any time limit, but wants to use e.g. filters. Even this does not support the case where only start or end date should be set...
|Note that this method of cleaning up the model does not handle recurring events correctly. QOrganizerTestUtility.empty_calendar  handles also recurring items. Probably in this case it does not matter because there are no recurring items in the test data.

Naming strategy needs to be unified at some point, not necessarily in this patch.

- Different abbreviations for Qt Personal Information Management have been used: QtPIM, QtPim and Qt PIM. I would suggest having Qt Pim if abbreviation is needed.

- addon might be Add-On or add-on...

- I would prefer 'QML List View' instead of 'Qt Quick List View'

|Patch Set 2:

Sorry about the delay getting back to you regarding this contribution. We have have a similar control in the works internally in The Qt Company, so that is the reason we have chosen not to look too closely at this code yet. We hope to know more within a month or two, and hope it is OK that we wait to review this patch until then?
|Patch Set 7: (5 inline comments)

I think this overview provides a lot of good stuff, and I think this works for the beta, but I still think it can be improved before the final release. E.g. I question a bit the areas we are highlighting. I don't know what the correct list should be, but 

- should we really be highlighting e.g. JSON DB here?  
- perhaps modularization and its benefits deserve a separate heading?
- do we have other highlights that are worth mentioning?

Also I think we should not forget to mention the general benefits of Qt, or at least link to them. People who read this might never have used Qt before, and therefore are interested in hearing about Qt's cross-platform benefits etc. Not sure if you somehow can start with the general benefits of Qt, and then move to what is new and better in Qt 5 compared to Qt 4.x.?

I don't hate you - quite opposite. You have valid points. The first one is a mistake and easy to fix. I also paid some attention to the third point, but decided to go with the default value as a good enough option. With these two and an auto test this might be tolerable fix, but on the other hand, there is no reason to hurry and fix this poorly. I am hesitating if I should try to do it all or just abandon this change now.

I noticed that QHeaderView::moveSection() has
if (stretchLastSection() &amp;&amp;  to == d-&gt;lastVisibleVisualIndex())
        d-&gt;lastSectionSize = sectionSize(from);

It strongly suggests that the last section is intentionally not stretched when the section is moved to the last visible position. I don't know the reason behind this, and therefore I am wondering if we should not change the behaviour in moveSection() after all. Thorbjorn, what do you think?

swapSection() doesn't have similar code snippet.

Hm adding PE_IndicatorArrow to http://doc.qt.io/qt-5.6/qstyle.html#drawPrimitive would require to make every call to it match the documentation.
I think the current state of documentation make it very hard to decide whether to make it a QStyleOption or one of its subclasses.
Passing one of the subclasses probably won't do any harm but currently we probably tend to forget to pass a copy of the subclass instead of the base class to some of the calls.

|It's according to the comment at init-repository:568:

```
$module = $gd;  # We expect it to be always absolute.
```

But my old checkout of qt5 has relative path in .gitdir for some submodules. For example, for qtdocgallery.
|Explain please.
|All qt5's submodules is located in top-level folder, therefore .gitdir is always located in /path/to/qt5/&lt;submodule&gt;/.gitdir.

In case of absolute path we do nothing with that. But in case of relative path, .gitdir file will always look like:

```

$ cat qtdocgallery/.git

gitdir: ../.git/modules/qtdocgallery

```

When processing git_install_hooks, working dir is '/path/to/qt5' so the real path we want is '/path/to/qt5/.git/modules/qtdocgallery'.

But here, on lines 578-579 we just adding '/hooks/commit-msg' to the $module path, and so we are failing to get '$PWD/../.git/modules/qtdocgallery/hooks/commit-msg' because the '/path/to/qt5/../.git' directory doesn't exist.

Obviously solutions are:

1. Change working directory to submodule dir

2. (my choice) cut the leading '..' in $module path
|Now I see. You suggest to pass a submodule name as the second argument of rel2abs. But it's the same thing! My way is just cut the '../' off. Your way is rel2abs(&lt;submodule&gt;/../*).
|Unfortunately it will not work because we are not in submodule directory.

Not sure what happened there. Now it's the real patch
|Patch Set 2:

regarding your last comment: you would think that to be the case but in fact it was never so. Yes it was taken into consideration during layout, but then it failed during paint where it was assumed to be 0. In order to avoid nasty source code incompatibilities I don't think we should change behaviour, (other than to make sure it layouts the right width)
It's much cleaner to have a new dedicated method to do what never worked before, rather than changing behaviour.

Well apart from the fact that the current API (which isn't documented) doesn't work, no then I can't give any other use cases, but please read my answer to you comment where i analyse why it may be smart to create a new api
|Uploaded patch set 4.
|Patch Set 4:

You asked for a use case where the old &quot;API&quot; wouldn't suffice.

Well think of RTL text. For RTL you only change the width not the x to achieve the indentation. So effectively the tab offset doesn't work for Rtl text.

And this is assuming we still wanted to fix the bug that prevents the current &quot;API&quot; from working
|Patch Set 4:

I'm sorry but this does not make sense. You are basically proposing that both mine and Esben's idea should be implemented.

And fair enough that you are okay with the behavioral change. But you should know that there may be much source code out there that set the position before layouting. because today it doesn't matter. With this behavioral change we are forcing them to change their code, which might be quite complex.

As for indentation it would have to be a per line property, as how else would Qt know what is just a random width and what is a width made smaller by indent.

So now we should use my method (the indent property aka tab offset) when RtL text. And Esbens method (the x value) when LtR text. So x should not have a influence when RtL. and line indent should not have influence when LtR. Sorry but this is even worse.

You mention weird tab and indentation interaction, but I must inform you that odf handles this interaction in two different modes so we need to support both. A toolkit that locks us into one mode is not usable for us.

Please I've been thinking this through for half a year now.

Oh and no tabs are actually moved in my solution. It's only happening during layout based on the offset.
|Patch Set 4:

If memory footprint is the concern i guess we could just store integer values in a short int (rather than a 4byte QFixed)

Since the class already contains a short this would just bring the total memory up to a 4 byte alignment. On many systems this will mean that the footprint hasn't grown.
|Patch Set 4:

No I didn't misunderstand. I do use line x position to achieve indentation. The problem is that the code I moved have no effect on tab positioning (or rather it probably has an effect during layout but when drawing to screen it hasn't)

So i removed the code that uses line.x because:
 1) it made the layout at odds with what is drawn. but sure the drawing could probably be fixed. But my point here is that since it doesn't work today it may give nasty surprises to other users that can't easily adapt their code to such a drastic behavioral change.
 2) using line.x doesn't work for indentation of RtL text. For RtL text indentation is achieved by making the width smaller, however there is no way for the layout to know why the line is made less wide.

So using line.x position to do tabs (like in the non-working  thing i removed) will screw the RtL text users in this world.

Thus my conclusion is that the only way to support RtL is to introduce a per line value.

Pros:
1) It the simplest thing.
2) It works for RtL.
3) It doesn't change current behavior unless you set the value

Cons:
1) It takes another 4 bytes (maybe none if you do as i suggested though it's less nice imo)

Ps. with the acceptance of http://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,12744 I need to update this patch but will do so tonight.

My mistake, sorry.
|Patch Set 1:

Note: I'm pretty sure this is correct.

I've tested this in some constellation, and neither early nor double free or a leak occured.

A more formal point of view:

1. new QDomTextPrivate(...) generates t with ref = 1
2. parent()-&gt;insertAfter(t, this); increases ref
3. QDomText::splitText, QDomText(t) increases ref again. (QDomNode::QDomNode constructor)

Thus final reference count is three, while only two references exist, ergo the reference needs to be decremented by one, which this patch does.

|Patch Set 1:

See QTBUG-40561 it contains a minimal example demonstrating the bug.
|Patch Set 1:

As a memory leak entirely related to incorrect reference counting and not caused by defects in an internal data structure I'd say one could create a test case for this checking the reference counts.

However, no such test cases exist for any other operation (I've checked that, nowhere in the QtXML tests the refcounts are accessed or asserted). Adding tests for each operation modifying reference counts would be quite an amount of test cases... to say the least.
|Uploaded patch set 2.
|Patch Set 2:

This patch set is much larger, because I moved all private Dom class declarations to qdom_p to enable testing internals like reference counts.

Test added which fails without the fix (wrong refcount) and passes with it.

btw. should I backport this to the 5.4 branch? I'm unsure (more on the &quot;don't&quot; side actually), since this is not a P1 and the patch is rather large due to the necessary exporting of the internal API for tests.
|Patch Set 4:

Porting to QSharedData would be quite a major change, wouldn't it? But on the other hand there should be no more memory leaks since refcounting is done 'automatically' and fixes like this one should be obsolete...
|Patch Set 1:

I don't know, I use Qt4.8. I know there isn't Cleanlooks style in Qt5. This bug appers when the style is changed to Cleanlooks, because height of listview items in this style more than in the other styles.
But in Qt5 sources I see that the list of all widgets is QWidgetSet too, therefore, QEvent::StyleChange may be sent to QComboBoxListView earlier to QComboBox, and the delegate will be updated later than new positions of listview items will be calculated.
Thus, even if this bug doesn't appear in the standard styles of Qt5, it's fraught for custom styles.
|Patch Set 1:

This bug appears not always. Only when QComboBoxListView is before than QComboBox in the list of all widge (QWidgetSet), i.e. when the pointer &quot;this&quot; of QComboBoxListView less than the pointer &quot;this&quot; of QComboBox.
I work on Linux too.
Excuse me, did you try one or more times?
I think, you need to do:
1) run styles example
2) change style to Cleanlooks
3) open combobox and check rendering of listview items
4) close application
and repeat these steps several times (for example, about 10).

In both cases, close() or quit(), function QWindow::destroy() is called and native underlying window (QEglFSWindow, in this case) is deleted. But after that destructor of QSurface (second base class for QWindow) is called. And there doneCurrent() for current opengl context, and therefore eglMakeCurrent(), is called. But surface has been deleted, and we are trying to work with wrong pointer to surface. I have checked it by adding debug to gbm in function dri_flush_front_buffer and I have seen that we have deleted pointer to surface (QEglFSKmsIntegration::destroyNativeWindow() --&gt; gbm_surface_destroy) and after that we have tried to work with the same pointer in eglMakeCurrent.

|Thanks for the review. I will add event.setChild(index) since it needs to notify about the name change for the child.

Regarding &quot;checks for that the value is actually changed is preferred&quot;, the name is stored in QTabBarPrivate::Tab.

As described in QTBUG-46530, some users don't want to set a simple text for a tab, but rather use setTabButton() to set a customized wiget on the tab. In this case, since the text is empty, screen readers get the empty name of a tab and are unable to annonce the name due to the empty name. Adding the APIs enable users to set accessibleName in case users don't want to set texts for tabs. Hope I made it clear.
|Patch Set 1:

Can you please let me know if you are referring to the widget set on the tab? If so, since users can call QTabBar::setTabButton() to set two widgets on the left or right hand side of a tab depending on the specified position, it would be confusing to decide which widget's text should be used for accessibleName. If I misunderstood your comments, please let me know:-)

@Friedemann It appears that the existing code assumes all drives returned by QDir::drives() are valid and readable. Some of the mapped network drives returned by QDir::drives() are disconnected and not accessible. Since the exisiting code assumes the drives returned by QDir::drives() are readable, it calls blocking I/O functions such as GetFileAttributesEx() on disconnected mapped network drives to get attributes of those drives, which is the main cause of QTBUG-6039. This patch does the following: detect mapped network drives and connection status of the mapped drives, and the QFileInfo code now don’t call the blocking I/O functions on disconnected mapped drives, which fixes QTBUG-6039. QDir::drives() now returns local drives and all existing mapped network drives on a system. But the patch doesn’t yet provide APIs in QFileInfo for checking if a drive is a mapped network drive, if a mapped drive is connected, etc.  The APIs can be added later. 
Regarding adding the functionality in QStorageInfo() instead, I haven’t studied QStorageInfo yet. How is QStorageInfo used in the existing code? Do QFileDialog or related classes use QStorageInfo?

@Oswald The only change in QFileInfo is to make QFileInfoPrivate a friend class of QFileInfo. Could you elaborate your concerns?

I will split the changes into two separate patches: one for the changes made in corelib, and the other for the changes in widgets.
